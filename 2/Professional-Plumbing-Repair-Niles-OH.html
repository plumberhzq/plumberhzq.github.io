This is simply a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the supply of water pipeline. The height is needed to conquer the ambient atmospheric pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high avoids a siphon from forming. Its benefits are the simplicity of its design and absence of moving parts. However, it may be unwise in many circumstances to install a pipe sector of this length. In addition, a barometric loop will not avoid back pressure from forming as the result of a pump failure.</p>
