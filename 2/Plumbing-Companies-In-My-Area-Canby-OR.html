<p>Your initial step is to shut off the water. In many cases, you'll have a shutoff valve right next to the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you do not have a shutoff, switch off the supply of water at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your home. This is a good time to include a shutoff valve beside the toilet or replace one that leaks. This is also a great time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Image 6). A versatile supply line reinforced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in your home centers and hardware shops. Pictures 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve. Set the height before you install the valve (Picture 5) if the height of your valve is adjustable. Check the instructions if your valve is a various design from the one we show. After installing the valve (Picture 6), connect the fill tube (Picture 7).</p>
