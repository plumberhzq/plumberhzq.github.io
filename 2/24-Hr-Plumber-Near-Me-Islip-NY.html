If you have a clogged sink in your bathroom, you can try to unclog it the sink yourself utilizing a sink plunger. If the clog is too far down the pipes or you can't fix it by yourself, call the expert plumbers at Roto-Rooter.

<p>If you find a leak and choose a patching task instead of a repiping job, just bear in mind that all the pipes in your home are most likely made from the same product and they might be next. To avoid even more, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you might want to consider repiping your entire home when you find a leak. If your plumber's auger line is too brief to reach to the end of the pipe, go as far as you can from the front of the drain, then begin at the end of the drain and work backward.</p>
