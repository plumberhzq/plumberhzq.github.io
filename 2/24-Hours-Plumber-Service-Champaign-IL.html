When the waste must take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and then change direction to fall down the trap, this is especially true. Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee permits a direct line to the trap that's fairly friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
