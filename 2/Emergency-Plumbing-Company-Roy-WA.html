While there's not a precise schedule regarding when you need to repipe your house, you ought to certainly look into repiping if they have not been carried out in 50 years or more-- specifically if you live in an older house developed closer to the turn of the last century. The Supertech serviced our ac system and got it up and running right in time for the warmer weather condition. The only thing that I would have liked was to have the tech explain what exactly was wrong with the system, how he fixed the issue, and how to avoid a reaccuance. I would extremely advise Hunter for any issues you might have.</p>

Your waste disposal unit comes with a. hex wrench that can be used to insert into the opening situated at the bottom of the system. Attempt to place a broom handle or plunger into the sink drain opening and attempt to rotate the jammed flywheel if you can't find this wrench.
