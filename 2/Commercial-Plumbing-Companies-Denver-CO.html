<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves must remain open and the system must be constantly monitored. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm system that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both approaches. NFPA 13 refers to all such devices as supervisory gadgets.</p>

<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
