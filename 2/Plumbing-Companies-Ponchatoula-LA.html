The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe section streams backwards relative to the instructions of the system's supply of water motion. This opposite circulation is typically localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller pipes based on car traffic on overlaying streets, vibrations from surrounding heavy equipment operations, settlement of neighboring soil or shifting structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, and so on. The result is a total breakage, dislocation or splitting in the pipe that allows water to escape.
