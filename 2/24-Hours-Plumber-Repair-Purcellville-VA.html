Read our reviews to see what people are stating about our water heater services. If your water heater has actually needed several repairs over the last couple of years, it may be time to get it replaced. An excellent general rule for hot water heater is this: since the life expectancy of the average water heater is in between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the middle. It makes more monetary sense to replace your water heater if the cost of a repair is more than half the cost of a replacement at that point.</p>
<p>However, this cost can as much as double when streets, pathways, driveways or utilities lie above the broken pipe. Displacing or restoring these ground-level components can run standard pipe repair costs as high as $25,000, if not more, for a single task.
