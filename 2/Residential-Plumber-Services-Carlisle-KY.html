<p>When there are cracks or holes in your sewer line, sewer line repair is recommended. If damage is severe, replacement of the line is suggested. These are all signs that your unit should be inspected by a plumber.

You must also prevent utilizing any type of chemical drain cleaners on your garbage disposal due to the fact that these chemicals will only harm the appliance further.</p>
