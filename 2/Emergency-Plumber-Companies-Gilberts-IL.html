A gas water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical hot water heater cost about $400 to $800). That repair expense is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Go for the brand-new heater. To ensure that we are offering top quality work and client comfort, all our plumbers are background-checked, licensed, bonded, and thoroughly trained to securely perform hot water heater replacements. In addition to conventional water heaters, we likewise install tankless water heaters, and heat pump water heaters.</p>

If you have a gas unit, the pilot light might go out, resulting in little or no warm water. In basic, conventional water heaters are expected to last 7-10 years with appropriate maintenance. If you're moving into a brand-new house, check the age of the existing water heater.
