We've already seen what these 2 terms share, so what's the distinction in between them? When it comes to the concern of hard water, a traditional water softener actually eliminates silica, magnesium and calcium ions, leaving it with little amounts of what is known as momentary solidity". The softener replaces these ions with salt through a procedure called ion exchange.</p>
<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health risk for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Normally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to start with. Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in salt is minor, but if you've been advised by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low sodium diet this increase can pose problems.</p>
