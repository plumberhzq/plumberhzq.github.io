<p>. Leaking Joints: The seals in between pipes have decomposed or broken, enabling water to get away into the ground surrounding the pipes. Examine the sewer lines from property to curb connection, sewage-disposal tank, and drainage systems to thoroughly examine if pipe damage, corrosion, or significant clogs exist. Tree roots are among the most significant causes of a sewer line backup. As roots enter into the drain line they can trigger blockages and back up into your house.</p>
