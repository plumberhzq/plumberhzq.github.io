If you smell a gas leak in or around your house, there are safety precautions you should take to protect yourself, your household and your house. Some jurisdictions likewise enable alternatives to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems providing devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the supply of water. This removes the need for a backflow preventer, because every time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>

Mix about a cup of baking soda with a half-cup of salt, and put down the drain. Let the mix sit for a number of hours, then flush with boiling water. If it does not work the very first time, you can repeat this process. We do warm water heaters installations and repairs in Carmel, Fishers and Greenfield, IN, Indianapolis and the surrounding counties.</p>
