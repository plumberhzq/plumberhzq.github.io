<p>Sometimes a garbage disposal simply stops to work and you can't find out the cause. Waste disposal unit problems can be credited to a range of possible problems. The disposal might be clogged or jammed with an item that is tough to discover or comprehend, and many house owners are wary of trying to fix a waste disposal unit themselves (and for excellent reason!).

Inspect the list of state licensing agencies to find out whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List also maintains a licensing tool to examine state licensing requirements.</p>
