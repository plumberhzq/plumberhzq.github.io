Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow demand, tanks come online to include flow rate capacity. Throughout periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line.
