The brine tank is essentially a tank for sodium chloride (NaCl) or potassium chloride (KCL) which is combined with water during the salt water refill and regrowth cycles. This salt water (a focused solution of salt water) is drawn back into the mineral tank throughout the regrowth phase to replenish the softener bed. The salt or potassium chloride is a sacrificial media and must be renewed on a regular basis to ensure adequate softening form the device.</p>
<p>The typical cost to add or covert a house to natural gas is $1,273 to $3,416, with a minimum cost of $711 and an optimal cost reported of $9,540. Gas line repairs cost $6 to $7 per direct foot. Plumbers charge $45 to $150 an hour for gas line sets up or repairs.
