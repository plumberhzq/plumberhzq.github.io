<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather sensible. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super delighted with their service.</p>
