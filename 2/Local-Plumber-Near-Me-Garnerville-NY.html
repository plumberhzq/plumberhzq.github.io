<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most common type of device. It has 2 check valves in a completely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow protection. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow scenario. When you eventually check a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That means that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense fails (both check valves stop working to hold), a backflow scenario might occur. That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a public utility thinks about high danger" facilities.</p>
<p>When the drinkable supply piping is linked to a system or component which goes beyond the operating pressure of the supply piping, backpressure may take place.

Drinkable and non-potable water or liquids can be required into the safe and clean supply system if these connections are not appropriately protected. Backflow Preventer definition: A device that allows water to go through it in one instructions, but prevents it from reversing in the opposite instructions.</p>
