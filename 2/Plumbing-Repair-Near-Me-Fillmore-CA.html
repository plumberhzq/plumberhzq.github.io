Not only can unclean pipes trigger your water to drain slowly, but it can also cause pipes to burst and sewage-disposal tank back-ups. Guarantee you do not have a plumbing disaster and make certain your pipes are clean. Check water or air test on system. Air Test: 5 psi or Water Test: 10 foot head of pressure. The test will hold for at least 15 minutes without leakages. 2. DO toss a couple of lemon or orange peels into your disposal from time to time to help it operate properly - and to make your kitchen odor fresh and clean.</p>
<p>A new hot water heater will likely last longer, offer you fewer problems, and cost you less to operate with time. Sluggish drains: If you see that your drains are emptying slower, it might be a sign of the early stages of a clog. A trained plumber would not advise a replacement unless the initial toilet was broken beyond repair, even if that holds true they may advise moving toilets to different bathrooms to reduce any future interruptions. Hot water heater should be supplied by High 5 Plumbing.</p>
