<p>Water that has actually been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- corrosive.

Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not trigger this kind of deterioration A softener is merely capturing some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (generally sodium or sometimes potassium).</p>
