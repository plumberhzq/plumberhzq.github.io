<p>A water softener has a resin tank containing thousands of small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When freshly restored, the beads end up being filled with salt ions from the water softener salt. As tough water goes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are brought in to the resin beads. There, sodium ions are exchanged for the difficult water ions. The softener system then delivers soft water for your use. When water is heated, tough water triggers gray or white deposits. Water softening can be used to decrease these symptoms.</p>
<p>Current Evaluation: Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather sensible. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
