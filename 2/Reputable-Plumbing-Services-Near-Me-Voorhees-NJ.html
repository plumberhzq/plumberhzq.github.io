<p>Installation and replacement expenses are frequently equivalent, though replacement normally will not need surcharges, such as application charges. New meters must fulfill guidelines and code requirements for their placement, and gas companies may require a special meter for their services, limiting your choices. Do-it-yourselfers and contractors are accountable for scheduling inspections by calling the workplace number listed on the structure permit. Inspections need to be made after structure excavation (prior to pouring concrete), after rough-in (before concealing work), and upon conclusion. NOTE: If defective work is discovered, the inspector will provide an offense notification, and a specific period of time is allocated to correct the issue.</p>
