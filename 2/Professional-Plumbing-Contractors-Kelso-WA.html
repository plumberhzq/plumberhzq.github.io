<p>Water heaters are checked for any indications of leaks, rust, or damage. If appropriate, all gas lines need to be inspected as well. Since a hot water heater is a point of numerous leaks in the house, this will provide you comfort and ensure that your household has a continuous supply of hot water.

For a good seal, hold the hose so it aims directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the adapters. Make them handtight, then include another quarter turn with pliers. Connections that are too tight can actually cause leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. Check for leaks and tighten them a bit more if needed.</p>
<p>Are rust or minerals building up in your water? The two telltale signs of rust and mineral accumulation are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals accumulate with time, they gradually start to constrict the circulation of water, leading to low water pressure.
