<p>There are a few types of water heaters to pick from, each style has its drawbacks and advantages.

<p>Search for quality materials when replacing an under-sink assembly. Avoid flex pipe that can be bent into any setup, along with flexible rubber traps. Debris can quickly capture in this kind of piping while the piping's versatile nature does not offer needed assistance for the drain basket. PVC assemblies are a great option s they can be quickly connected to metal drain pipes. Seal connections with silicone and ensure it sets before testing the drain.</p>
