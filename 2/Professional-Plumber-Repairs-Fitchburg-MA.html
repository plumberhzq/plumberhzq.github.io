<p>Depending upon the brand name and design of your toilet, a new tank can cost about $34-$ 255 from your local house improvement shop to replace the old one. Our plumbers in Albuquerque are certified, skilled and fully-equipped to detect and repair your drain issue on the area.

<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason that we will recommend a full repipe in specific communities, based on our experience.</p>
