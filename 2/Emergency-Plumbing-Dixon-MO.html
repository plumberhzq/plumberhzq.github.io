<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to understand what the field test data implies for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester translates the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>

There are various faucet styles, so you may not have the ability to tell what to replace till you've done the disassembly. Whether you do it yourself or employ a plumber, this would be a good time to consider whether you want to update the faucet with a brand-new style.</p>
