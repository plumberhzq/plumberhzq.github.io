<p>Unfortunately, when water is entirely stripped of calcium and magnesium to become soft, it frequently becomes corrosive. Corrosive water causes leaching of copper pipes and faucet components, particularly in areas where water sits for long periods of time. Although this is not a health concern, it is the main reason for the green and blue discolorations being left in your bathroom and utility room sinks. The majority of residential water heaters cost $150 to $400 for either gas or electric, plus $200 to $450 if you have a plumber install it. More costly gas water heaters with unique venting systems also are offered. But they're harder to install, and we won't deal with them here.</p>
