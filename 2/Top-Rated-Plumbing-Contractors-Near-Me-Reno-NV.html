<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are normally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are centers designed for the short-term staging of water materials and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators instead of water storage systems. Because water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay roughly consistent, use never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is greater than need (generally night-time hours), the excess water supply is safely and cleanly kept for later usage when need rate goes beyond supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
