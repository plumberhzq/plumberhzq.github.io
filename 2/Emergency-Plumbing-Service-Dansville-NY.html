<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water system line pipe that was developed in the 1970s. It was in fact promoted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was simpler to install. Regrettably, any home that plumbed with polybutylene resembles a ticking time bomb. It is not a concern of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or backed up drain pipe is a problem. Sometimes a property owner can unclog a drain with a commercial product or with a plunger. Often unclogging a drain takes dismantling the plug and putting a hook to take out hair and gunk. And sometimes even then absolutely nothing gets that drain cleared, not even basing on one's head and muttering necromancies to the drain gods.</p>
<p>A. We highly suggest a backflow preventer or vacuum breaker on any shared water source. Backflow preventers obstruct any water from back or negative pressure in your watering system at shutdown from going into back into your water source, thus minimizing the risk of contamination of your water source. Many towns need using an approved backflow preventer in drip irrigation systems. You may want to contact your local municipality prior to installing your watering system.</p>
