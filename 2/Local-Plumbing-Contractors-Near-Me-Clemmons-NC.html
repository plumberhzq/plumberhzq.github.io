<h3>Find Registered Plumbers in  Clemmons NC</h3>
<p>Warning: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on many rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts down. Since the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system, this is. The probability of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however for the most part it should be much less water.</p>
