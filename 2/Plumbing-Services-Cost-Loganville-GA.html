<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most common type of device. It has two check valves in a totally closed body-- 2 layers of backflow protection. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow circumstance. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually test a backflow preventer. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes.

That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a public utility thinks about high risk" establishments.</p>
