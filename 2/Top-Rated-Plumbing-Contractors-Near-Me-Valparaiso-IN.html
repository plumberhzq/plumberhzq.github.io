It includes an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In basic functional use, water pressure presses the seat up and shuts off the air inlet.

Every system may not need a decreased pressure concept backflow assembly.  In far too many locations we have an all or absolutely nothing method to backflow protection. We need to take a look at each installation for the hazard it provides and then install the correct security.</p>
