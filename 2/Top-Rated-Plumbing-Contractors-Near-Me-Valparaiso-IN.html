It includes an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In basic functional use, water pressure presses the seat up and shuts off the air inlet.  When the water flow stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, permitting the device to drain in addition to preventing back siphonage.

Every system may not need a decreased pressure concept backflow assembly.  In far too many locations we have an all or absolutely nothing method to backflow protection. We need to take a look at each installation for the hazard it provides and then install the correct security.</p>
