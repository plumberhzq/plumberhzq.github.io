<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are usually set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are facilities created for the short-term staging of water supplies and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators instead of water storage systems. Because water need differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay approximately constant, usage never precisely matches supply.
