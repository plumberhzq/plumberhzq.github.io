<p>Throughout typical operation, the pressure between the 2 check valves, described as the zone of lowered pressure, is preserved at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve need to leak, the relief valve is created to open and discharge water to the outside.

For this factor, the RPZ must be installed in locations that are exempt to water damage and permit sufficient drainage.</p>
<p>Based on research carried out by the Water Quality Association (WQA) Water Softener Advantages Study, 2011. Switch on the gas and check connections for leakages by brushing a 50-50 mixture of dishwashing liquid and water over the joints. If the mixture bubbles, you have a leak. Tighten or reconnect joints that leak. When completed, clean the joints dry. Call the plumbing inspector to check over your work. Follow the how-to suggestions that accompanies the images to make certain the connections are tight.</p>
