<p>This is an elbow-shaped device bent at a 90 degree angle. There is a valve on the within it that prevents water backflow. The system is based upon pressure and must be installed a minimum of 6 inches of where the downstream will be. It can be placed on PVC pipes, but is not testable.

<p>Current Evaluation: Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the previous. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather reasonable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very happy with their service.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that they can hinder the blades, cooking oil and other greases need to never be put down the garbage disposal. Lastly, cold water ought to be running when the garbage disposal is on and must continue to run for 30 seconds after the disposal is turned off to guarantee that all food particles have been washed through the pipes. Baffles: Baffles prevent flatware from going into the garbage disposal, so you're only sending out food and compostable waste down the drain.</p>
