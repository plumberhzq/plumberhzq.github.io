<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like product coated with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water streams through the system while the resin launches its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>David Davia is the Executive Vice President & CEO of the Colorado Association of Mechanical and Plumbing Contractors. He called several of his member contractors to find out what a fair and reasonable  rate would be for a garbage disposal install. Water softening refers to the removal of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular technique of water softening is through a procedure called ion exchange. During ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another kind of ion-- generally sodium. The result is water that's been successfully softened by getting rid of nearly all traces of the minerals that constitute tough water.</p>
