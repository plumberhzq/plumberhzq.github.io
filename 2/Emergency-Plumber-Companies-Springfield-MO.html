<h3>Before Calling For Emergency Plumbing On Your Flooded Toilet Springfield MO</h3>
<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water supply line pipe that was developed in the 1970s. It was really touted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was easier to install. Unfortunately, any home that plumbed with polybutylene is like a ticking time bomb. It is not a question of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or supported drain pipe is a problem. In some cases a homeowner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. Sometimes unclogging a drain takes disassembling the plug and putting a hook to pull out hair and gunk. And often even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even basing on one's head and muttering incantations to the drain gods.</p>
