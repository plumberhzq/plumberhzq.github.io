If your unit is outlet-ready-- focus on this part-- make sure your disposal switch remains in the off" position before you plug the new unit in. While it's not likely that having a disposal start up while your head is pressed versus it will lead to decapitation, it might scare a number of years off your life. Not that I would understand from experience. When to repair: Under no situations should your toilet move when you sit or press on it.
