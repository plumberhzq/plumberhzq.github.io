<p>You'll need an unique garbage disposal if you home utilizes a septic tank and drain field. The system must grind the waste even finer to avoid blockages and allow the tank to be able to drain properly into the leach fields. As soon as, the gas pipe shows up from the ground (called the riser"), it can continue to be covered, but should then shift to galvanized. I am unsure why that should be. It is also permitted to utilize black iron if it is most likely coated with a galvanized finish (which is essentially a special paint"). When plumbing in their gas meters, PG&E frequently does this.</p>
