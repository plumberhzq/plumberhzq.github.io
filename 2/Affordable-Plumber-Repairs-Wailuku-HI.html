<p>Water that has actually been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been gotten rid of-- destructive. For this reason, WQA advises that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not cause this kind of rust A softener is simply catching some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations while doing so (normally salt or often potassium).</p>
