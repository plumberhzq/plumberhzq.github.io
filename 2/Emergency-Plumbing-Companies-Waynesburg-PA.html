<p>A recently set up hot water heater must not produce odd noises, but it will start to create rumbling noises as it ages. The sounds get louder in time as the heater runs to heat the water. Things aggravate considerably for families with a high demand for hot water. The factors for the sounds can be the accumulation of sediments in the tank which must be flushed to bring back normalcy. A water heater replacement might be essential if the water heater still produces rumbling sounds even after it has been flushed.</p>
