<p>Re-piping is a procedure of replacing the supply pipes in a dwelling or business. It is not a short-term fix or a replacement of short sections of pipe, however a total replacement of your supply plumbing system. There are numerous factors you might need to repipe your house or business. Corrosion of pipes may cause low water pressure, rusty colored water, reduced water flow, or leaks. , if you are going to remodel it is a good time to repipe before you paint or finish your walls..

For instance, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leaks between the tank and bowl.

Much like with the gasket, sometimes your tank to bowl washers and bolts can end up being so used or corroded that they spring a leak. We highly suggest likewise changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure whatever is in good shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
