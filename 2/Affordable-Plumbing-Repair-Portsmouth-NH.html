<p>Current Evaluation: Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into.

I was very happy with their service.</p>
