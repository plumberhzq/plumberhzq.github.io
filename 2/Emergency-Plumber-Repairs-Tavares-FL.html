<p>Pretty little flappers may get all the glory in the toilet world, but the journey lever is the bridge in between man and machine. After all, if the journey lever doesn't raise the flapper to flush the toilet, you need to jerk and wiggle and in some cases even stick your hand in there and raise the flapper manually. And who wants to do all that work???

<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason why we will advise a full repipe in particular communities, based on our experience.</p>
