After that the softener can be disconnected, moved to its new location and placed there.

For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm system that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both approaches. NFPA 13 describes all such devices as supervisory gadgets.</p>
