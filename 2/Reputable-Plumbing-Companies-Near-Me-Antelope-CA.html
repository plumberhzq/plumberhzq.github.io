<p>Professional sewer inspections give plumbers an in-depth check out the pipeline at your home, allowing them to diagnose pipe function and condition. When you have an issue with your sewer line, you need a professional inspection to properly identify the issue. Bob Oates Plumbing, Sewer, & Rooter has actually been a leading company for pipeline plumbing, sewer, and rooter services in the greater Seattle, Washington area for several years.

<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very quickly. This is the main reason we will advise a complete repipe in certain communities, based on our experience.</p>
