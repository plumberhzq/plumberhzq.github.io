<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves should stay open and the system should be continually kept an eye on. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as simple as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems make use of both techniques. NFPA 13 describes all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>

The beads end up being full of salt ions from the water softener salt when freshly regenerated. As difficult water goes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are attracted to the resin beads. There, sodium ions are exchanged for the hard water ions. The softener system then provides soft water for your usage. Hard water causes gray or white deposits when water is warmed. Water softening can be utilized to reduce these signs.</p>
