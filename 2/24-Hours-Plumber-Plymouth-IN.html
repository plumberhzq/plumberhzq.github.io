Do you have questions or have an interest in our financing alternatives? Call us toll-free at 877-688-6426. All piping (water, sewer, storm water or vent system) must be evaluated (generally with water) and exposed for inspection prior to burial or covering with wall, floor or ceiling coverings. A final inspection of all finished fixtures or plumbing should also strike liquidate any permit.</p>
<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to just abandon the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason we will recommend a full repipe in specific communities, based upon our experience.</p>
