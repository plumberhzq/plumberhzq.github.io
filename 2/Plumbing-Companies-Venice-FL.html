<p>Backflow preventers should just be fixed when the data gathered from the field test suggests the assembly has broken down in its performance below the established minimum basic. The test treatment is a diagnostic assessment of the operations of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to fulfill this minimum standard, the backflow preventer must be repaired or if necessary, replaced.

The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working specifications. This implies the assembly is repaired so that it can perform above the minimum requirement.</p>
