<p>Try to find a jam. Something too hard to grind, such as a piece of glass, might be jamming the motor. Switch off the power and water, then unplug the disposal (If it's hardwired, turn off the breaker.) Eliminate the rubber baffle inside the drain-most simply raise out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the obstruction with a set of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For instance, backflow can occur when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use. Water is no longer being pressed forward into your house and will stream backwards into the city water lines due to the fact that pressure is lost during these occasions.</p>
