New meters must fulfill regulations and code requirements for their positioning, and gas suppliers might require a distinct meter for their services, limiting your options. Do-it-yourselfers and contractors are accountable for scheduling inspections by calling the office number listed on the structure authorization. Inspections must be made after foundation excavation (prior to putting concrete), after rough-in (before concealing work), and upon conclusion.
