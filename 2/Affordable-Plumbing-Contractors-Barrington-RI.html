<p>Trying to find professional Albuquerque garbage disposal installation and repair services? Eventually, however, the beads reach maximum capacity and can't draw in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank need to be regenerated, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank is available in. An on-board computer system determines the amount of water that flows through the softener. Regeneration immediately begins when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom home and family of four, regeneration normally happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
