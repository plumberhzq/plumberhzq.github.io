<p>Despite the Romans' common usage of lead pipes, their aqueducts seldom poisoned people.

<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. When there is a decline in provided pressure to the water flow, takes place. The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment flows in reverse relative to the instructions of the system's water supply movement. This opposite flow is generally localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller sized pipes based on car traffic on overlaying roads, vibrations from nearby heavy equipment operations, settlement of nearby soil or shifting structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, and so on. The outcome is a total breakage, dislocation or cracking in the pipe that enables water to escape. Often no obvious physical damage to the pipe is needed, just the mechanical failure of a crucial pump whose closed down results in a significant pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>
