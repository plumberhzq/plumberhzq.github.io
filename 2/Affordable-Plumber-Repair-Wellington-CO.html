Continuous feed garbage disposals are the most typical, and the type most plumbers recommend. They're wired to an ON and OFF switch, discovered either under the sink or on a neighboring wall. In the ON position, the disposal runs at a consistent speed which allows you to grind food waste as fast as you can work.
