These tanks are filled with adversely charged ion exchange resin.  The brains of the softener lie in the control valve or softener head as it is commonly referred to. Most popular water softeners have an automatic regenerating system.  The most basic type has an electric timer that recharges the system and flushes on a regular schedule.</p>
