If your current toilet is nearing completion of its life expectancy, or even if you're just tired of spending too much on your water bill, we can replace it with a brand-new design that uses less water.

<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to include circulation rate capability. During durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
