<h3>How To Repair Your Water Heater in Seymour TN</h3>
<p>What is tough water? Scientifically speaking, it is water which contains significant amounts of liquified minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending on for how long the water travels through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can get a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals won't harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and rather a nuisance-- for its many desired usages around your house.</p>
