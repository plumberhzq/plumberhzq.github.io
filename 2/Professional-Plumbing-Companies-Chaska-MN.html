A great deal of sink clogs that take place are much deeper than you may think, and the intensity is so serious that a typical store-bought drain cleaner or impromptu home drain cleaning solution can not fix. Ease of access - If the toilet remains in a hard-to-reach area, having access to pipes and even the space behind the tank is limited, so repairs could cost more.
