<p>The Mesopotamians introduced the world to clay sewer pipes around 4000 BCE, with the earliest examples discovered in the Temple of Bel at Nippur and at Eshnunna, 7 used to get rid of wastewater from sites, and capture rainwater, in wells. The city or Uruk includes the oldest known examples of brick built Latrines, built atop adjoining fired clay sewer pipes, c. 3200 BCE. 8 9 Clay pipes were later used in the Hittite city of Hattusa 10 They had easily detachable and changeable segments, and permitted cleaning.</p>

<p>Making use of different metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic deterioration Direct contact in between different metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever 2 different types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is developed since of the procedure. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to mitigate this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
