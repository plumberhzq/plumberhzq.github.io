<p>A water softener has a resin tank consisting of countless small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When newly regenerated, the beads become full of salt ions from the water softener salt. As tough water passes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are brought in to the resin beads. There, salt ions are exchanged for the tough water ions. The softener system then delivers soft water for your use. Hard water causes white or gray deposits when water is warmed. Water softening can be used to reduce these signs.</p>
