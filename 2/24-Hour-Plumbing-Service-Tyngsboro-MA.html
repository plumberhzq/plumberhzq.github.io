<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite affordable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly delighted with their service.</p>
