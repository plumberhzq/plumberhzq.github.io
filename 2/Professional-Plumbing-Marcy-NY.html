Short-lived water will be permitted after the contractor sets up a hose bibb assembly consisting of a vertical PVC riser at the water meter with a hose bibb on a 90-degree elbow at the top.  A vacuum breaker need to be attached to the hose bibb at all times.  The discharge opening from the vacuum breaker must be at least 12 inches above grade.  The riser must be firmly connected to strong rebar or wood stake to include structural stability to the assembly.  The direct connection in between the water meter and the structure plumbing before the structure is substantially complete is restricted unless a check backflow assembly is installed and instantly tested to assure it is working.</p>
