<p>All of the drains in your home, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your house then exit into the sewer or septic tank from your house.

<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. takes place when there is a decline in supplied pressure to the water flow. The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment flows in reverse relative to the direction of the system's supply of water motion. This opposite flow is typically localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller sized pipes based on vehicle traffic on overlaying streets, vibrations from adjacent heavy equipment operations, settlement of nearby soil or moving foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, and so on. The result is a complete damage, dislocation or breaking in the pipe that allows water to leave. Sometimes no obvious physical damage to the pipe is needed, simply the mechanical failure of an essential pump whose closed down results in a considerable pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>
<p>If you decide to attempt this job yourself, be prepared to keep careful track of about a dozen small parts (put the stopper in the sink so none drop the drain). There are several faucet styles, so you may not have the ability to tell what to replace until you've done the disassembly. Whether you do it yourself or hire a plumber, this would be a great time to think of whether you want to upgrade the faucet with a new style.</p>
