<p>You can discover lots of repair guidelines on the web, so the first thing you need to understand is that for anything beyond a frustrating drip-drip-drip you ought to close the shutoff valves below to save water and secure against the leak unexpectedly becoming worse while you're sleeping or away.

<p>During the regeneration cycle, salt water (brackish water created in the salt water tank by blending water and salt) is travelled through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the design). As this salt water travels through the tank, sodium ions are moved (exchanged) for the firmness ions on the exchange resin and these solidity ions are subsequently sent out to drain. This procedure continues till all the hardness ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll observe small amounts of salt going to drain in addition to the firmness ions) and the bed is thought about completely regrowed.</p>
