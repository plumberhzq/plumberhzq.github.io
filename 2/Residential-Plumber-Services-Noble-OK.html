<p>Saint Paul Regional Water Services (SPRWS) requires plumbing contractors to obtain a plumbing permit prior to setting up or changing a backflow preventer. Your hot water heater. The pro will next check your water heater. With your water heater, he or she is taking a look at water temperature level, pressure relief valves and pipes, and any rust in the tank (unless it's a tankless hot water heater ).
