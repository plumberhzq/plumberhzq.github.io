<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your business' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's perhaps the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
