<p>Searching for professional Albuquerque garbage disposal installation and repair services? Eventually, however, the beads reach maximum capacity and can't bring in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank need to be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank is available in.

<p>Align the rubber seal ring on the top of the disposer with the flange underneath the sink.
