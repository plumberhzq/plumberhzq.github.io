Age-- As we discussed, a 10+ years of age water heater is most likely on its last legs. If you are not sure how old your system is, you must be able to get that info from the identification number on the producer's sticker (normally near the top of the unit). Generally, the very first two numbers indicate the year of your hot water heater.</p>
<p>Your old discharge tube probably will not be the ideal length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, merely connect it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if essential, to place television back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too brief, you may have to make a time-wasting trip to the store. To avoid this, ensure the new garbage disposal installation kit includes a tube, or buy one independently at the exact same time for about $3.</p>
