<p>Food scraps compose approximately 20% of all household waste. This large quantity of garbage does not need to go in the trash bin if it can easily and quickly be disposed of through the sink. A garbage disposal works by shredding the waste into tiny pieces that are capable of traveling through the sewage pipes without impeding water flow.

With a garbage disposal the trash is managed through currently existing water infrastructure.</p>

<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of many repairs, there are plenty of other little toilet parts that should likewise be well kept to help prevent leakages and other toilet problems. For instance, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense against leakages in between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can start to harden and break or merely be so squished that it does not fill the space along with it used to, and you end up with water all over the location. Just like with the gasket, sometimes your tank to bowl bolts and washers can end up being so used or rusty that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we strongly advise also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to ensure whatever remains in great shape.</p>
