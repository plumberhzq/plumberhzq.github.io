<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water embraced the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Subsequently residential permits issued after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was evaluated at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was checked was attached. By code this backflow assembly must be evaluated every year. Likewise permits issued for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard watering systems need an each year test. It is needed that this assembly is evaluated in the spring before running the watering system. All testable backflow preventers need to be tested each year to guarantee the security of the safe and clean drinking water in your house.
