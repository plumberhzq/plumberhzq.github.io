<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water embraced the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Subsequently residential permits released after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was evaluated at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was checked was attached. By code this backflow assembly should be tested annually. Likewise allows released for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard irrigation systems need an each year test. It is required that this assembly is evaluated in the spring before operating the watering system. All testable backflow preventers need to be evaluated every year to guarantee the safety of the safe and clean drinking water in your house.

This is required to stabilize the plumbing system and ensure the structural integrity. Copper piping has been the requirement for many years and is generally deemed the premier type of repiping. We utilize Type L" copper, which is the premier grade of copper. Our company believe that if you are going to buy copper piping, do it once, do it right.</p>

<p>To the end user (consumer), SpringWell Water (SpringWell") warrants that the following Covered items- retention tanks and mineral tanks (14" or larger) shall be devoid of any flaws in material and craftsmanship for a period of 10-years under typical application, service and usage. They were running a bit late due to earlier service calls, but I offer the company props for calling to upgrade us on the later arrival time.
