No matter the reason your garbage disposal has stopped working, you can rely on Preferred House Services for quickly, affordable waste disposal unit repairs in Charleston.</p>
<p>Cooking oil and other greases should never be put down the waste disposal unit since they can restrain the blades.

Baffles: Baffles prevent silverware from entering the garbage disposal, so you're just sending food and compostable waste down the drain.</p>
