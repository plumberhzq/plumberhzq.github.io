<p>Replace what's exposed. For a home with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other features that make it hard to gain access to in-wall pipes, consider at least replacing pipes that aren't buried in the walls. Although it's a huge job, replacing exposed pipes in a basement, crawlspace, or energy  room is fairly uncomplicated, because the plumber can easily get at the pipes. This is a bad sign. Toilets ought to absolutely never wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. If you can move a toilet around by doing anything less intense than swinging a sledgehammer at it, that toilet ought to be changed. Improperly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, or perhaps jeopardize the structural integrity of the house.</p>
