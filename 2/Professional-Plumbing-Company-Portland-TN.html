<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future.
