<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing Freehold NJ</h3>
<p>Reverse osmosis is the process used to cleanse water utilized for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through three stages. In the prefilter phase, big particles like silt and rust are removed by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen travel through the pores while dissolved solids are caught and gotten rid of. Lastly, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last phase of filtration to remove any remaining impurities.</p>
<p>The most effective method to deal with tough water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When tough water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
