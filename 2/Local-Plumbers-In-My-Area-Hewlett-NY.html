<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to provide soft drinks drinks. Numerous, if not most, pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water enters into contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate option (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been proven to be a danger to the gastrointestinal system. The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a minimized pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping containing copper shall be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>

<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health threat for individuals on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Typically, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to begin with. More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in sodium is small, but if you have actually been recommended by a physician to follow a stringent low sodium diet this increase can present problems.</p>
