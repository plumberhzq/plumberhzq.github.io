<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are typically installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are facilities developed for the short-term staging of water products and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators instead of water storage units. Since water need varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain approximately constant, usage never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those durations where water circulation is greater than demand (generally night-time hours), the excess supply of water is safely and easily stored for later usage when need rate exceeds supply (usually throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
