<p>310 Sewer Service: Inspects connection of the structure drain to the sewer for correct depth of burial, authorized piping products and fittings. The ditch needs to stay open up until inspection approval.

<p>When you get rid of the cap to flush out the valve, inspect the washer for wear or cracks. Replacing a bad washer is cheap and easy. But finding the right washer might not be. The most common washers are typically offered at home centers and hardware stores. Other designs can be tough to discover.
