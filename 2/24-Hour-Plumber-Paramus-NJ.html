<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason why we will advise a complete repipe in specific areas, based upon our experience.</p>
