<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves need to stay open and the system should be constantly monitored. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm system that informs the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both methods. NFPA 13 refers to all such devices as supervisory gadgets.</p>
<p>Your sewer line issue can lead to sewer backups, and they normally happen in the most affordable open drain. This type of issue is generally the result of a blockage in the line.

Every drain in your home depends on the main sewer line for proper drainage. If, nevertheless, only one drain has backup problems, there's a separated problem with just that drain, which is not likely to be a sewage problem.</p>
