Sediment accumulation is a typical problem with hot water heater New Orleans, specifically in older systems. Over time, calcium, magnesium, and limescale can collect on the sides of the tank and around the burner. These minerals must be strained of the unit so they don't create a sediment barrier on the burner and interfere with hot water heater efficiency. Water heater filtration can flush out these minerals and avoid a breakdown. The burner should also be inspected occasionally to ensure that the flame is blue with a yellow tip.
