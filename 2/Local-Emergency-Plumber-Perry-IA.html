A lot of plumbers, pipefitters, and steamfitters learn their trade through a 4- or 5-year apprenticeship. Apprentices usually receive 2,000 hours of paid on-the-job training, as well as some technical direction, each year. Technical instruction consists of safety, local plumbing codes and regulations, and plan reading. Apprentices also study mathematics, applied physics, and chemistry.
