<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most common kind of device. It has 2 check valves in an entirely closed body-- two layers of backflow security. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow situation.

That indicates that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the 2nd line of defense fails (both inspect valves fail to hold), a backflow scenario might take place. That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a water company thinks about high danger" facilities.</p>
