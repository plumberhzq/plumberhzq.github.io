Today's high-efficiency softeners are changing the economics of water softening in the carwash industry. Typically, the cost savings have been based mainly on decreasing chemical and cleaning agent expenses. While those savings are still considerable, new commercial softening technology using multi-tank systems (MTS) also uses considerable water and salt savings.</p>
<p>With tankless electrical heaters, water is warmed straight whenever it's required. Tankless systems particularly make use of a component that heats up water when the tap is turned on.
