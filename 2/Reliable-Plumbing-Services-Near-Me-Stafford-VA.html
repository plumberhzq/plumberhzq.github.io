<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like product covered with positively charged sodium ions.

The water flows through the system while the resin releases its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>

<h3>The Dreaded Blocked Toilet in Stafford VA</h3>
<p>Gas is an important utility we utilize every day to keep our workplaces and homes warm, our showers hot, and to prepare our food. With the daily use of gas, it is understandable it is understandable that gradually a leak is bound to take place. When a leak appears, it is very important to understand the signs, symptoms, and how to act. Remember to take precautions when handling gas home appliances, utilize the previously mentioned signs to recognize prospective leaks, and call a plumber to have your gas lines frequently inspected and maintained.</p>
<p>Your first step is to shut down the water. In many cases, you'll have a shutoff valve right next to the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you don't have a shutoff, shut off the water system at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your home. This is a great time to include a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leaks. This is also a great time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Picture 6). A flexible supply line reinforced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in your home centers and hardware shops. Pictures 1 - 8 demonstrate how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height prior to you install the valve (Photo 5). Examine the directions if your valve is a different design from the one we reveal. After mounting the valve (Picture 6), connect the fill tube (Picture 7).</p>
