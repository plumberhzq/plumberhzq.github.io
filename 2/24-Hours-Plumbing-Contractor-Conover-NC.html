<p>Need backflow prevention assemblies and assemblies within a facility as laid out in the state needed plumbing codes. The water suppliers normally do not have the capability to consistently inspect every customer's facilities for cross-connections and backflow protection. Usually, this would include the water service connection to each committed fire security system or irrigation piping system and the water service connection to each of the list below kinds of facilities: (1) facilities with an auxiliary or recovered water system; (2) industrial, medical, lab, other or marine centers where objectionable substances are dealt with in such a way that could cause contamination or contamination of the public water supply; (3) facilities exempt from the State Plumbing Code inspection and premises where an internal backflow prevention assembly needed under the State Plumbing Code is not properly installed or preserved; (4) classified or limited centers; and (5) tall structures.</p>
