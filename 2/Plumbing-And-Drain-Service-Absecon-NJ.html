In a lot of states, other than Kansas, you are accountable for any gas piping on your home from our gas meter to your house or organisation. Atmos Energy does not keep the gas lines on your residential or commercial property beyond our meter, this is the exact same as other utilities, such as your electrical circuitry and water pipes.</p>
<p>Your first step is to turn off the water. In most cases, you'll have a shutoff valve right next to the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you do not have a shutoff, switch off the water system at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house. This is a great time to add a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leaks. This is likewise a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Image 6). A flexible supply line reinforced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in the house centers and hardware shops. Pictures 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve. Set the height before you install the valve (Image 5) if the height of your valve is adjustable. Check the instructions if your valve is a various style from the one we show. After installing the valve (Picture 6), connect the fill tube (Photo 7).</p>

Although other valves will look various, the clearing process is similar. Nevertheless, you might need to remove a couple of screws on top of the fill valve to eliminate the cap.</p>
