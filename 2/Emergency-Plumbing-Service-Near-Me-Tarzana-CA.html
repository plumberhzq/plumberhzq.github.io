<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to only desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason that we will recommend a complete repipe in specific areas, based upon our experience.</p>
