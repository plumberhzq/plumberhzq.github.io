<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capability. During durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's probably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
