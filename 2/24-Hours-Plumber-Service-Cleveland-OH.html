Like any home appliance, a toilet tank features lots of little moving parts that may need changed with use gradually. Flapper valves, fill valves, and other tank parts can all wear and trigger toilet leakages that aren't clearly noticeable to the naked eye.

<p>More complicated is the double check valve assembly (DCVA). This device has actually found widespread use considering that it prevents both siphonage and back pressure. The paired check valves are organized in line with the pipeline and operate separately of each other.

Each spring-loaded check valve is set to enable water at awaited functional pressure to stream through. Need to backflow occur, either due to siphonage or back pressure, the springs slam the valves shut tight, preventing the entrance of cross contamination water.</p>
