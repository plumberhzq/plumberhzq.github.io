Like any home appliance, a toilet tank features lots of little moving parts that may need changed with use gradually. Flapper valves, fill valves, and other tank parts can all wear and trigger toilet leakages that aren't clearly noticeable to the naked eye.

Each spring-loaded check valve is set to enable water at awaited functional pressure to stream through. Need to backflow occur, either due to siphonage or back pressure, the springs slam the valves shut tight, preventing the entrance of cross contamination water.</p>
