The mounting assembly elements are a bit various in between the 2 mounting systems, however the process is mainly the same.</p>
<p>To minimize the need of gas line repair, it is necessary to understand the common causes of gas leakages. Indoor gas leaks from heaters, stoves, ovens and other gas-burning devices happen most commonly in the winter.

We advise installing carbon monoxide detectors outside of bedroom doors to alert you of any prospective gas leaks if you haven't done so currently.</p>
