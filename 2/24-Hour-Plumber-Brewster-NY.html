<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to supply soft drinks drinks. Many, if not most, pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water comes into contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate option (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been proven to be a danger to the gastrointestinal system.

Additional requirements: no piping including copper shall be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>
