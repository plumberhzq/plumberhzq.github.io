<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of 2 classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a predetermined schedule and then go back to service. These work well for households that are on routine water-using cycles however will waste more water and salt since they regrow whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, normally regrow after so many gallons of water have actually been softened.

<p>Finally, the most complicated and sophisticated backflow preventer is the reduced pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than five separately operating valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve functions as a back up system to the other four. During standard water streams at style pressure, the 2 check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage occurs to the linked service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a advanced and reliable  (if pricey) device is best used in important areas where cross contamination could be a direct threat to life and health.</p>
