Although your garbage disposal frequently goes unnoticed in your kitchen it can really cause problems when it stops operating or gets clogged. Check to make sure it's not your waste disposal unit that's triggering the issue. A clogged disposal can stop up the drain, so run the disposal to see if that clears the clog. Then inspect it to make sure it's running correctly. You may need to flip the switch found on the side or bottom of the unit beneath the sink if the disposal has overheated.</p>
