<p>Reverse osmosis is the process used to purify water utilized for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through three phases. In the prefilter stage, large particles like silt and rust are removed by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen go through the pores while dissolved solids are caught and removed. Finally, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last stage of filtration to eliminate any leftover impurities.</p>
<p>A leaking toilet is another typical problem property owners experience. After you flush, if the water continues to run, this more than likely means your toilet has a leak. This concern is typically caused by a rusty pipe, flush valve assembly or as easy as a worn flapper valve. A drip pan is economical and effective. The drip pan is installed under the hot water heater in order to collect any extraneous leaking water. The drip pan can be piped to drain the water outside the home or into a suitable drain. An ideal time to install a drip or replace pan is when the hot water heater is being changed.</p>
