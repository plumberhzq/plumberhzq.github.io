Insert cable connector (not consisted of) and run electrical cable television through access hole on bottom of garbage disposal. Tighten cable adapter. Press wires into waste disposal unit (do not displace cardboard shield) and replace electrical cover plate.</p>
<p>Usually across the country, it costs between $120 and $150 to install a waste disposal unit.
