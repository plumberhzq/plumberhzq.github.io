<p>Leaks are sly. While the time required will vary based upon your home size and the number of discovered breakdowns, it's best to set aside up to 2 hours when you schedule an inspection.

If the plumber surfaces in 15 minutes, and dashes off to their next appointment, they likely rushed the job (unless you have a very little plumbing system). When you call to schedule your appointment, ask the length of time the inspection usually takes.</p>
