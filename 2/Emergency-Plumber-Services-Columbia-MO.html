<p>Once the parts are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the drawback turned off remains in the closed position. This enables the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in an accurate motion. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air should be eliminated from the body. A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from critical locations in the assembly.

<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. The majority of house centers bring only one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest far more.
