<p>There are various products used in re-piping, in water supply re-piping a few of the materials are metal and maybe some plastic pipes. The metal pipes are galvanized steel or brass, iron, and copper. The plastic pipes are Poly Vinyl Chloride PVC, Chlorine Poly Vinyl Chloride CPVC, Poly Ethylene PE, Polybutylene PB, and Kitec.
