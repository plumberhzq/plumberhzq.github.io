A clogged or supported drain pipe is an issue. Sometimes a homeowner can unclog a drain with a commercial product or with a plunger. Sometimes unclogging a drain takes dismantling the plug and putting a hook down to take out hair and gunk. And often even then absolutely nothing gets that drain cleared, not even standing on one's head and muttering incantations to the drain gods.</p>
<p>Copper is a strong product that won't come down with large-scale deterioration and total pipe failure. That's why it's the trusted metal for pipe replacement nowadays.
