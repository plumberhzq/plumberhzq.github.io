<p>So, how does a softener know when to come down to business? The timing of regrowth depends on the kind of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and charge on the basis of a predetermined schedule-- say, 11 p.m. every three days, regardless of whether the water actually requires it. When needed, more recent units use electronic sensors that keep track of bead depletion and other key metrics based on your water usage and for that reason just restore. These newer systems, also referred to as demand-initiated regeneration softeners, are perfect due to the fact that they conserve energy and cash-- utilizing less water and salt for regeneration.</p>
