<p>One of the most typical toilet problems that we get required are issues with toilet blockages. Nevertheless, there are numerous different problems that can occur to your toilet. Although some toilet problems may not look like they are worth the problem of calling a plumber, ignoring the issue might be costing you cash or worse - lead to a more extreme problem.

<p>Due to inaccurate appliance installation or a gas line hookup that was not done properly. If the cost to repair your water tank is 50% or more than the cost of a new one, getting a new one is more affordable. Plumbing and piping technology has enhanced over the last 30 years. Copper has actually been the favored option to replace galvanized iron pipes (which used to be considered extremely strong, but they were found to break under pressure and tend to corrode within a couple of years). Today, most quality contractors utilize PEX or copper pipes.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Many house centers bring only one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" model, the door may not close. Read on to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
