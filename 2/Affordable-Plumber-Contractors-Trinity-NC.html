<h3>Licensed Plumbing & HVAC Company In Trinity NC</h3>
<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water supply line pipe that was established in the 1970s. It was in fact touted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was much easier to install. Unfortunately, any house that plumbed with polybutylene is like a ticking time bomb. It is not a question of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or supported drain pipe is a problem. In some cases a homeowner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. In some cases unclogging a drain takes taking apart the plug and putting a hook to pull out hair and gunk. And often even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even basing on one's head and muttering incantations to the drain gods.</p>
<p>If you find a leak and opt for a patching job instead of a repiping job, simply keep in mind that all the pipes in your home are probably made from the same product and they might be next. To avoid further, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you might wish to consider repiping your whole house when you spot a leak. If your plumber's auger line is too brief to reach to the end of the pipe, go as far as you can from the front of the drain, then begin at the end of the drain and work backward.</p>
