<p>Iron fouling is another typical maintenance issue for water softeners. Although colorless, minimized iron will be removed by the system, red-oxidized iron (iron that has been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening insures that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. Commercial cleaners are offered if the resin has actually already been fouled. Once again, it is advisable to inspect the manufacturer's guidelines for unique preventative measures.</p>
<p>If you have a newer system, a simple repair or changing private parts might be all that's needed to get your water heater working once again. You might be tempted to weld or spot a leak shut or replace only a single section of pipe to conserve cash. While this might operate in the short-term, bear in mind that the weakened pipe is made from the exact same product as other pipes in your home, suggesting that difficulty might be brewing elsewhere in your plumbing system. Repiping now will provide you assurance and prevent bigger leakages down the road.</p>
