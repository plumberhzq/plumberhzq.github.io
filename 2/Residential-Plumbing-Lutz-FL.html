<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. takes place when there is a reduction in provided pressure to the water circulation. The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe sector flows in reverse relative to the direction of the system's supply of water motion. This opposite flow is usually localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller pipes subject to car traffic on overlaying highways, vibrations from adjacent heavy equipment operations, settlement of nearby soil or moving structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, and so on. The outcome is a total breakage, dislocation or splitting in the pipe that permits water to get away. In some cases no apparent physical damage to the pipe is required, simply the mechanical failure of a crucial pump whose closed down results in a substantial pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>
