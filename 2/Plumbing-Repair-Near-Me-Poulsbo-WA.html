<p>Ultraviolet disinfection systems use UV light to destroy micro-organisms and offer purified water. The energy source required to heat the water is less expensive. Calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions that cause water hardness can be removed relatively quickly by using an ion exchange treatment. Standard water softeners are cation exchange gadgets. Cations describe favorably charged ions dissolved in the water. Cation exchange includes the replacement of the solidity ions with a nonhardness ion.</p>
<p>During the regrowth cycle, brine (brackish water created in the brine tank by blending water and salt) is gone through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the design). As this salt water travels through the tank, salt ions are transferred (exchanged) for the firmness ions on the exchange resin and these solidity ions are as a result sent out to drain. This procedure continues up until all the solidity ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll see small amounts of salt going to drain in addition to the hardness ions) and the bed is considered totally restored.</p>
