The disposer unit is heavy and can be uncomfortable to steer underneath the sink. Utilize a large bowl or other tough challenge prop up the unit as you position it. Water softeners normally have a lifespan of 15 years, nevertheless, water softener systems can last a lot longer if they are properly preserved. Ensuring the salt water tank never runs out of salt will extend the unit's life.  Protecting the resin bed from high levels of iron and manganese will also protect the system.
