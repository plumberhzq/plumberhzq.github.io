<p>Throughout the regeneration cycle, brine (brackish water developed in the salt water tank by mixing water and salt) is passed through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the style).

This procedure continues up until all the firmness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll see percentages of salt going to drain along with the hardness ions) and the bed is thought about completely regenerated.</p>
