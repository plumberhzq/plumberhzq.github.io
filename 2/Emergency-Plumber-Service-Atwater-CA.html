<p>Your first step is to shut down the water. Most of the times, you'll have a shutoff valve right next to the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you do not have a shutoff, turn off the water system at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house. This is a good time to add a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leaks. This is also a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Picture 6). A flexible supply line strengthened with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in your home centers and hardware shops. Pictures 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve. Set the height before you install the valve (Image 5) if the height of your valve is adjustable. If your valve is a different style from the one we reveal, inspect the instructions. After mounting the valve (Picture 6), connect the fill tube (Picture 7).</p>
<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most common kind of device. It has 2 check valves in a completely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow protection. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow situation. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you ultimately test a backflow preventer. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both examine valves fail to hold), a backflow scenario might happen. That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a water company considers high risk" establishments.</p>
<p>Although the service technician concurred that the customer did the ideal thing in her efforts to tighten up the pipes, the professional saw that the pipe had ended up being exceptionally rusted over the years which a PVC pipe might be much better matched for the client's needs. He turned off the supply of water to the home, got rid of the corroded system and fit a PVC pipe in its place. Before leaving the house, the professional restored water flow and tested the pipe.</p>
