<p>Replace what's exposed. For a home with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other features that make it difficult to get to in-wall pipes, think about at least replacing pipes that aren't buried in the walls. Although it's a big job, replacing exposed pipes in a crawlspace, basement, or energy  room is relatively straightforward, due to the fact that the plumber can quickly get at the pipes. This is a bad indication. Toilets must definitely never ever wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. That toilet should be replaced if you can move a toilet around by doing anything less extreme than swinging a sledgehammer at it. Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, or even jeopardize the structural stability of the home.</p>

<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to provide soft drinks drinks. Lots of, if not most, pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water enters into contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate option (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has actually been proven to be a risk to the gastrointestinal system. The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a minimized pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping consisting of copper shall be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>
