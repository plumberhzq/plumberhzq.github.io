<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super delighted with their service.</p>
