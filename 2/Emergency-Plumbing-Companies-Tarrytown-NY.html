This is simply a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the water supply pipeline. The height is needed to get rid of the ambient air pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high prevents a siphon from forming. Its advantages are the simpleness of its style and lack of moving parts. Nevertheless, it might be not practical in many situations to install a pipe sector of this length. Moreover, a barometric loop will not avoid back pressure from forming as the result of a pump failure.</p>
