Throughout the repipe, holes are made in walls to install the new piping. These holes are covered following the installation.</p>

<h3>No Hot Water - No Problem, Fix Yourself in Winthrop MA!</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves must remain open and the system must be continually kept an eye on. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm system that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems make use of both methods. NFPA 13 refers to all such gadgets as supervisory devices.</p>
