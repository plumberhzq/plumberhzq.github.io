Numerous insurer will not cover a slow leak. Claims might be denied due to the fact that the basic HO-3 homeowners' policy specifically leaves out "a loss as the result of a water leak over a prolonged period of time." Call your insurance coverage representative and verify your coverage. Once you have gone through your policy and validated what is covered and what is not covered, check with your agent to validate that your understanding is proper.</p>
