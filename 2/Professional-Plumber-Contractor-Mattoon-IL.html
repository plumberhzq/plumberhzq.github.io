<h3>How to Remove a Sink Drain Pop Up in Mattoon IL</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves should remain open and the system needs to be continuously monitored. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm system that informs the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both methods. NFPA 13 describes all such gadgets as supervisory gadgets.</p>
