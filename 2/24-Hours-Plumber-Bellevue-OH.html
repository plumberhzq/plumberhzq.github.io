<p>Will sears install my garbage disposal for me. The easiest backflow prevention device is the barometric loop. This is just a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the water supply pipeline. The height is needed to conquer the ambient air pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high avoids a siphon from forming. Its benefits are the simpleness of its design and absence of moving parts. However, it might be unwise in many scenarios to install a pipe section of this length. Moreover, a barometric loop will not prevent back pressure from forming as the result of a pump failure.</p>
