<p>A water softener has a resin tank consisting of thousands of small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When freshly restored, the beads end up being loaded with sodium ions from the water softener salt. As hard water goes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are attracted to the resin beads. There, salt ions are exchanged for the tough water ions. The softener system then delivers soft water for your use. Hard water triggers white or gray deposits when water is warmed. Water softening can be utilized to reduce these signs.</p>
