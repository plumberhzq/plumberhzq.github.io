<p>A water softener has a resin tank consisting of thousands of small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When freshly regrowed, the beads end up being filled with sodium ions from the water softener salt. As hard water passes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are attracted to the resin beads. There, sodium ions are exchanged for the hard water ions. The softener system then provides soft water for your use. Hard water triggers gray or white deposits when water is warmed. Water softening can be used to reduce these symptoms.</p>
