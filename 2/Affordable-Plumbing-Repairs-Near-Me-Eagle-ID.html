<p>I wanted to thank Clog Dawg Plumbing for the very best 1st experience with the start of our house improvements. George and Anthony did a fantastic job for us. They went above and beyond any expectations that we had. They also worked around our particular requirements for our house. I will always use them and request for George specifically for all future concerns or repairs. They were prompt and gave very good prices for what we required done.
