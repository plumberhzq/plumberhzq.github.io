Evaluate the sewer lines from home to suppress connection, septic system, and drainage systems to completely check if pipe damage, rust, or major blockages exist. Tree roots are among the biggest causes of a sewer line backup. As roots get into the drain line they can cause blockages and back up into your house.</p>
