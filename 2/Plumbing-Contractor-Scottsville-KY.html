If health or ecological factors necessitate restricting salt, substituting potassium chloride for salt chloride might be proper. In time, the beads end up being coated with minerals and have to be cleaned. This cleaning procedure, called regeneration, has three cycles: recharge, rinse and backwash. The regeneration process can be set up immediately with an electrical timer, through a mechanical water meter, or a computer.</p>
