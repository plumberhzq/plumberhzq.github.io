<h3>Clogged Tub Drain in Swanton Vermont</h2>

<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to provide soft drinks drinks. Numerous, if not most, water pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water enters into contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate option (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has actually been proven to be a danger to the digestion system. The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a minimized pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping consisting of copper will be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>
