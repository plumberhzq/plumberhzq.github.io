Backflow preventers are also required by the plumbing code. Except within Coastline, the plumbing authority for Seattle Public Utilities customers is King County plumbing (Public Health - Seattle & King County). The City of Shoreline is the plumbing authority within Coastline's city limitations. Seattle Public Utilities works with both King County plumbing and the City of Coastline when it pertains to backflow preventer requirements.</p>
<p>Poorly set up gas lines result in gas leakages. Gas leaks are pricey to repair. Gas line installation is not a do-it-yourself task. The gas lines need to be calibrated to the best levels by a certified professional. They reacted rapidly for my sewer leak. Jay B and Aaron scoped the job rapidly and explained the game plan for diagnosis and repair. They kept me informed and stood firm through really challenging sewer line cleanup and repair. I will advise SW plumbing for any significant repair.</p>
<p>Loosen the screws on the upper mount ring (flange mount) enough to press the phone a bit - you'll see a small "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the mount ring from sliding off the flange). Use a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and eliminate the mount ring and upper "protector" ring against the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if relevant) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the brand-new system.</p>
<p>Hard water, debris from old pipes or particles from a break in a city water line can avoid a flush valve from closing totally. Running water through it from the supply line will clear the debris. Photos 1 and 2 show you how to do this on one typical type of valve. Even though other valves will look different, the clearing procedure is similar. However, you might have to get rid of a couple of screws on top of the fill valve to get rid of the cap.</p>
