<p>Water that has actually been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- destructive. For this factor, WQA advises that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) ought to not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not trigger this kind of corrosion A softener is just recording some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (generally sodium or in some cases potassium).</p>
