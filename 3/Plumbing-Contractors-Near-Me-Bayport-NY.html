<p>Don't use harsh drain cleaning chemicals to attempt to unclog the system if your disposal is clogged. Chemicals can harm the mechanical parts, shortening the life of the disposal. Water leaks: If you see a leak in your pipes, there may be other leaks you are uninformed of. Leaks are a sure indication that your pipes are used and old and need to be changed.

<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to only desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason that we will recommend a full repipe in specific areas, based upon our experience.</p>
