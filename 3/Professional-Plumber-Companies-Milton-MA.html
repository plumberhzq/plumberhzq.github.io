<p>Saint Paul Regional Water Services (SPRWS) requires plumbing contractors to acquire a plumbing license prior to installing or changing a backflow preventer. Your water heater. The pro will next inspect your water heater. With your water heater, she or he is looking at water temperature, pressure relief valves and pipes, and any rust in the tank (unless it's a tankless water heater ). Some will also flush your hot water heater at this time, which is a yearly maintenance job that avoids difficult water and sediment buildup. To do this, the plumber will drain the water out of the tank with a hose and run clean water through the tank to wash out any buildup.</p>
<p>Disposers fasten to the sink drain fittings in a variety of ways-some usage threaded plastic nuts, others large hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly shown here is the most typical. To get rid of the disposer, support it from below and rotate the large, 3-tab installing ring on top counterclockwise up until the unit falls away. Get rid of the rest of the drain assembly by loosening the three bolts and prying off the maintaining ring. Push the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
