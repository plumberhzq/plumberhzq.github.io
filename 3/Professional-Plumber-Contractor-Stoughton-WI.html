<p>You might be acquainted with galvanized pipe for gas". Black iron pipe is, put simply, the very same thing, however without the zinc finish.

If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height prior to you install the valve (Image 5). If your valve is a different style from the one we reveal, inspect the directions. After mounting the valve (Photo 6), connect the fill tube (Photo 7).</p>
