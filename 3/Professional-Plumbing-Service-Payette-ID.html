<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of most repairs, there are a lot of other little toilet parts that must also be well preserved to help prevent leaks and other toilet troubles. For instance, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense versus leaks in between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can start to solidify and break or simply be so crushed that it does not fill the space as well as it used to, and you end up with water all over the place. Just like with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl washers and bolts can end up being so worn or corroded that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we highly advise also changing your gasket and your bolt set to make certain everything is in tip-top shape.</p>
