<p>Your sewer line issue can result in sewer backups, and they usually happen in the most affordable open drain. This kind of issue is typically the result of an obstruction in the line. If you do not find the odor originating from the sewer backup, you may recognize this problem because a backup takes place whenever you flush the toilet or run water in your bathtub or sink. Every drain in your house is dependent upon the main sewer line for proper drainage. If, however, just one drain has backup problems, there's a separated problem with only that drain, which is not likely to be a sewage issue.</p>
