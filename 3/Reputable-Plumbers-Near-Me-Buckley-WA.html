<p>Will sears install my waste disposal unit for me. The most basic backflow prevention device is the barometric loop. This is just a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the water system pipeline. The height is needed to conquer the ambient air pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high avoids a siphon from forming. Its benefits are the simplicity of its design and absence of moving parts. However, it may be unwise in lots of situations to install a pipe segment of this length. Furthermore, a barometric loop will not prevent back pressure from forming as the result of a pump failure.</p>

The flange (and associated gasket, if suitable) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the new unit.</p>
