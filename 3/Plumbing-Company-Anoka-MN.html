You may also discover a more progressive decrease in efficiency, as the water might take longer to heat up, or you may not have hot water for as long as typical when you are showering or doing the dishes.

PEX is simple to install, which suggests the cost of installation may be low as well. There is some threat of the PEX pipe splitting, though this is rare.
