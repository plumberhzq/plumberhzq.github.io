<p>Unless your bathroom renovation is purely cosmetic in nature, bathroom plumbing may very well be part of your task requirements. Water enters the top of the water-softener tank and percolates down through the resin beads. The resin has an unfavorable charge, which attracts the favorably charged minerals in the water (a procedure called, ion exchange). The mineral deposits hold on to the resin and the now-softened water exits the softener tank and flows throughout your house. Tankless innovation makes good sense.
