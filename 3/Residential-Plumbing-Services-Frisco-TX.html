Short-term water will be allowed after the contractor installs a hose bibb assembly including a vertical PVC riser at the water meter with a hose bibb on a 90-degree elbow at the top.

The riser should be securely connected to durable rebar or wood stake to include structural stability to the assembly.  The direct connection in between the water meter and the structure plumbing prior to the structure is substantially complete is restricted unless a check backflow assembly is set up and right away checked to guarantee it is working.</p>
