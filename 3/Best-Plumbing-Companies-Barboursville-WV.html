<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of the majority of repairs, there are a lot of other little toilet parts that must also be well maintained to help prevent leakages and other toilet problems. For example, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense against leaks between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can begin to crack and harden or just be so squished that it does not fill the space as well as it utilized to, and you end up with water all over the place. Just like with the gasket, sometimes your tank to bowl bolts and washers can end up being corroded or so worn that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we highly advise likewise replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure whatever remains in good shape.</p>
