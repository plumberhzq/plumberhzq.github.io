<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic supply of water line pipe that was developed in the 1970s. It was actually touted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was easier to install. Unfortunately, any house that plumbed with polybutylene is like a ticking time bomb. It is not a question of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or supported drain pipe is a problem. In some cases a house owner can unclog a drain with a commercial product or with a plunger.
