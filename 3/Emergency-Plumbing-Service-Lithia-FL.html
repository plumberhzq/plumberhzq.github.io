It cost less than copper and was much easier to install. Unfortunately, any house that plumbed with polybutylene is like a ticking time bomb. It is not a concern of if it will leak, however when. A clogged or supported drain pipe is an issue. Often a house owner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. Often unclogging a drain takes taking apart the plug and putting a hook down to take out hair and gunk. And sometimes even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even basing on one's head and murmuring necromancies to the drain gods.</p>
