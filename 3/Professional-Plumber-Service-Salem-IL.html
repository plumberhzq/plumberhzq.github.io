<h3>Emergency Plumbing Services Salem IL</h3>
<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates information on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test information suggests for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester analyzes the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
