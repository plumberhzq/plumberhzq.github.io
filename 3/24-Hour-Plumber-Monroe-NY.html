<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water embraced the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential authorizations provided after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was evaluated at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was checked was connected. By code this backflow assembly should be tested each year. Also permits issued for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn irrigation systems require an every year test. It is needed that this assembly is checked in the spring before running the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers need to be tested yearly to insure the security of the drinkable drinking water in your home.
