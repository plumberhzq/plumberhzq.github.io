<h3>Efficient Services Of Plumber Tarzana CA</h3>
<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years old and you have to work with a plumber for that burner kit. The total repair expense may remain in the $300 range. A gas hot water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair bill is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Go for the brand-new heater. To make sure that we are supplying high-quality work and customer peace of mind, all our plumbers are background-checked, licensed, bonded, and thoroughly trained to safely carry out hot water heater replacements. In addition to traditional hot water heater, we also install tankless hot water heater, and heat pump water heaters.</p>
