<p>Reverse osmosis is the process used to purify water used for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through 3 stages. In the prefilter stage, large particles like silt and rust are removed by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen pass through the pores while dissolved solids are captured and eliminated. Finally, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last phase of filtration to remove any remaining impurities.</p>
<p>If you are in a position that you discover the signs of a gas line leak, the most important thing to do is to get out of your home as quickly as possible.
