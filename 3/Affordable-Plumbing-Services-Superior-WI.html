<h3>Water Line Repairs in Superior Wisconsin</h2>
<p>Some manufacturers claim that the electrical devices they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Considering that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promo have been claimed, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just alter the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has actually revealed a reduction of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>

A softener is comprised of different components, each having their own distinct function. The heart of the softener is the mineral tank which is a pressure vessel typically built out of fiberglass.  These tanks are filled with negatively charged ion exchange resin.  The brains of the softener depend on the control valve or softener head as it is commonly described. Most popular water softeners have an automated regenerating system.  The most standard type has an electric timer that recharges the system and flushes on a regular schedule.</p>

<p>Unlike salt-based water softeners which use a procedure called ion exchange to get rid of difficult water minerals, salt-free water softeners utilize a physical process known as Template Assisted Formation (TAC). This process converts the hardness-causing minerals in the water to a firmness crystal that will not stay with any surface in your home, keeping your appliances and hot water heaters free of hard water scale develop. Salt-free softeners are also known as water conditioners because they do not actually soften" the water; They condition (or reduce the effects of) it. And due to the fact that these types of systems do not trap any minerals, there's no need for a cleaning cycle to get rid of caught ions.</p>
