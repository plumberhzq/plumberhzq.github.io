It consists of an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In standard operational usage, water pressure presses the seat up and blocks the air inlet.  When the water circulation stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, permitting the device to drain as well as preventing back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is really essential here.  This device just breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not secure against back pressure.  Consider this device as a frost-proof hose bibb with a vacuum breaker.  It also needs to be located a minimum of 6 inches above any overflow rim or downstream piping.</p>
