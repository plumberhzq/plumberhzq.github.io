Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral material.

More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in sodium is small, but if you have actually been encouraged by a medical professional to follow a strict low salt diet this increase can position problems.</p>
