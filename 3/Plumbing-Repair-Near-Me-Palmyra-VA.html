<p>Additionally, you should always run cold water while the waste disposal unit is on to ensure that food bits are completely pressed through.

<p>During the regrowth cycle, salt water (brackish water developed in the salt water tank by blending water and salt) is travelled through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the design). As this salt water goes through the tank, salt ions are moved (exchanged) for the firmness ions on the exchange resin and these hardness ions are as a result sent out to drain. This procedure continues till all the hardness ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll observe percentages of salt going to drain in addition to the firmness ions) and the bed is considered completely regenerated.</p>
