Big Blue Plumbing can handle the permit and purchase process. Mechanical backflow preventers have internal seals, springs and moving parts that undergo fouling, wear or fatigue. Likewise, mechanical backflow preventers and air gaps can be bypassed. For that reason, all backflow preventers have to be tested regularly to guarantee they are working properly.
