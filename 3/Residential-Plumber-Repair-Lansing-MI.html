It contains an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In basic functional usage, water pressure pushes the seat up and closes off the air inlet.  When the water circulation stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, allowing the device to drain as well as preventing back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is very essential here.  This device only breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not secure versus back pressure.  Think about this device as a frost-proof hose bibb with a vacuum breaker.  It also has to lie at least 6 inches above any overflow rim or downstream piping.</p>

Houses that utilize gas for heat or for other various devices have a gas line that connects directly to the heater, hot water heater, stove, and other devices that utilize gas. The most common gas used for residential homes is gas. Utility companies provide this gas to homes through an underground pipe system.</p>
<p>When the components are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized. It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the drawback shut off stays in the closed position. This enables the parts to move to their pressurized positions in a precise motion. When the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air needs to be removed from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from vital areas in the assembly. In some designs, test cocks can be utilized to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will collect.</p>
