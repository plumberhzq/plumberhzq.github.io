<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health risk for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Typically, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in sodium is small, but if you've been advised by a medical professional to follow a strict low salt diet plan this boost can present problems.</p>
