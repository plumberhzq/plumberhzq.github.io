Subsequently residential authorizations issued after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was evaluated at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was evaluated was attached. By code this backflow assembly must be tested every year. Also permits provided for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard irrigation systems need an annually test.
