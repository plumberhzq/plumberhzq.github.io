<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the previous. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather reasonable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
<p>Throughout the regeneration cycle, salt water (brackish water created in the brine tank by mixing water and salt) is gone through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the design). As this brine goes through the tank, salt ions are moved (exchanged) for the firmness ions on the exchange resin and these firmness ions are subsequently sent to drain. This procedure continues until all the hardness ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll discover small amounts of salt going to drain in addition to the solidity ions) and the bed is thought about fully regenerated.</p>
