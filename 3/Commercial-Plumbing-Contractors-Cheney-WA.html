<h3>Residential Plumbing Emergencies Cheney WA</h3>

A gas hot water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair expense is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Opt for the brand-new heater. To make sure that we are providing high-quality work and client comfort, all our plumbers are background-checked, licensed, bonded, and completely trained to securely perform hot water heater replacements.
