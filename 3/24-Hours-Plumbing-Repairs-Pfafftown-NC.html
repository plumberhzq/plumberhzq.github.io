<p>Lubrication may help with the placement of some components within the body of the backflow prevention assembly. Lubricant does not assist the assembly work any much better, it is only there to help the specialist put together the components into the body without producing damage from friction. The lubricant must be a food grade lubricant to assure the water system is not infected. In many cases the best lube is water. The usual usage for lube in the repair process, is on 'rings (not guides). All 'rings must be gently lubricated to ensure they do not roll out of their retainer. Making use of too much lube can cause the backflow prevention assembly to stop working or use out quicker by attracting dirt and debris or restricting the motion of the part.

<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most common kind of device. It has 2 check valves in an entirely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow defense. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow situation. When you ultimately evaluate a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense fails (both check valves stop working to hold), a backflow circumstance could occur. That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a water company thinks about high danger" facilities.</p>
