<p>Difficult water is softened by removing the calcium and magnesium it includes. When hard water travels through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange process, so only softened water goes through to your home.

Salt is generally utilized in the regeneration procedure and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start once again.</p>
