<p>Regenerate your softener with potassium chloride rather of sodium chloride (salt). Potassium chloride is offered at a lot of shops that offer softener salt.

A clogged drain can even result in slow water drainage, flooding, sewage backup, and costly repairs.</p>

This process continues until all the firmness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll discover small amounts of salt going to drain along with the firmness ions) and the bed is thought about fully regenerated.</p>
