A vacuum breaker should be attached to the hose bibb at all times.  The discharge opening from the vacuum breaker should be at least 12 inches above grade.  The riser should be securely connected to sturdy rebar or wood stake to include structural stability to the assembly.  The direct connection in between the water meter and the structure plumbing prior to the structure is significantly total is forbidden unless a double check backflow assembly is installed and immediately checked to guarantee it is working.</p>
