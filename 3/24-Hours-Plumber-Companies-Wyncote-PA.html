Consequently residential authorizations released after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was checked at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was evaluated was attached. By code this backflow assembly need to be checked annually. Likewise permits issued for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard watering systems require an each year test. It is needed that this assembly is checked in the spring prior to operating the irrigation system.
