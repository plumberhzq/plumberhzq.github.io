As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending upon the length of time the water travels through the ground before reaching your tap, it can pick up a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals will not damage your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and rather an annoyance-- for its numerous intended uses around your home.</p>
