<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are usually installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are facilities created for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators instead of water storage systems. Given that water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay roughly continuous, usage never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is greater than demand (normally night-time hours), the excess supply of water is securely and easily kept for later use when need rate surpasses supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
