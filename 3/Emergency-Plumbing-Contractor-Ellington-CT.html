<p>Backflow is bad news. Secure the drain hose. The water softener requires to drain the diminished brine service after the regeneration cycle. Clamp the drain hose firmly and feed it into the devoted drain, like a floor drain or energy sink. To avoid the hose back siphoning waste water, all drain tubes should have an air space.

PVC assemblies are an excellent choice s they can be quickly connected to metal drain pipes. Seal connections with silicone and make sure it sets prior to testing the drain.</p>
