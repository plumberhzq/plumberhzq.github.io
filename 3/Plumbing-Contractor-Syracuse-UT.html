<p>Some producers declare that the electrical gadgets they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Considering that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant growth promotion have actually been declared, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only modify the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has revealed a decrease of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
