<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water adopted the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Subsequently residential permits released after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was tested at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was evaluated was connected. By code this backflow assembly should be tested annually. Likewise permits issued for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn watering systems need an every year test. It is needed that this assembly is evaluated in the spring prior to running the watering system. All testable backflow preventers should be checked each year to insure the safety of the drinkable drinking water in your house.
