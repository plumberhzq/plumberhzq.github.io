<p>Gas and propane that comes out of the ground is entirely odor-free. The egg smell associated with gas is a chemical blended into it so that we can smell it. If you smell a gas leak in or around your home, there are safety precautions you ought to take to safeguard yourself, your household and your home. Some jurisdictions also permit alternatives to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems supplying dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water system.

<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are generally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally in between and aqueduct and the circulation water pipe. These are facilities developed for the short-term staging of water materials and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators rather than water storage systems. Because water need varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain approximately continuous, use never precisely matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is greater than need (typically night-time hours), the excess water system is securely and cleanly saved for later usage when demand rate exceeds supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
