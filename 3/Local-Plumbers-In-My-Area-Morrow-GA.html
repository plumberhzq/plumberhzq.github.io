<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service DFW Plumbing Service Morrow GA</h3>
<p>Warning: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is utilized on many rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off.

The possibility of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless most of the times it ought to be much less water.</p>
