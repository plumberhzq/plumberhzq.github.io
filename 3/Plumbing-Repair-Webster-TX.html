<p>Salt consumption from softened water can be prevented by leaving one kitchen tap unsoftened for drinking and cooking. Substituting potassium chloride for sodium chloride might be suitable if health or ecological factors require restricting salt. Over time, the beads become covered with minerals and need to be cleaned up. This cleaning process, called regeneration, has 3 cycles: backwash, rinse and recharge. The regrowth procedure can be arranged instantly with an electric timer, through a mechanical water meter, or a computer.</p>
<p>Not exactly sure whether you have a backflow prevention device set up? Normally, it's set up near your culinary stop and waste. Water softening shower heads can provide the same advantages as a water softening system. You'll be able to remove soap and shampoo without leaving any residue, leaving you with healthier hair and smoother skin. There are lots of water softening shower heads readily available, so you can easily find one that will suit your existing shower.</p>
