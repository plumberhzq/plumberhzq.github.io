<p>Replace what's exposed. For a house with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other features that make it difficult to access to in-wall pipes, think about a minimum of changing pipes that aren't buried in the walls. Although it's a big task, replacing exposed pipes in a crawlspace, utility, or basement  room is relatively simple, since the plumber can easily get at the pipes. This is a bad indication. Toilets need to definitely never wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. If you can move a toilet around by doing anything less extreme than swinging a sledgehammer at it, that toilet should be changed. Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, and even compromise the structural stability of the house.</p>
