<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most common type of device. It has 2 check valves in a completely closed body-- two layers of backflow defense.

Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually evaluate a backflow preventer. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force.
