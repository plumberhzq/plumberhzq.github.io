<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health risk for individuals on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Generally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to start with. Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in sodium is minor, but if you've been advised by a medical professional to follow a stringent low sodium diet plan this increase can present problems.</p>

<p>If you home uses a septic system and drain field, you'll need a special garbage disposal. The system must grind the waste even finer to prevent clogs and permit the tank to be able to drain correctly into the leach fields. Once, the gas pipe shows up from the ground (called the riser"), it can continue to be wrapped, but must then shift to galvanized. I am not exactly sure why that should be. It is likewise allowed to use black iron if it is probably covered with a galvanized covering (which is basically a special paint"). When plumbing in their gas meters, PG&E frequently does this.</p>
