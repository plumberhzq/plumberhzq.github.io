<h3>Five Things To Do Today To Avoid A Clogged Toilet at Riverside NJ</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves should remain open and the system should be continuously kept track of. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm system that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both techniques. NFPA 13 describes all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>
