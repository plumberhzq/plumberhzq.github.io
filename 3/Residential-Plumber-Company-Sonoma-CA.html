When needed, newer units utilize computerized sensing units that monitor bead depletion and other crucial metrics based on your water usage and for that reason only regenerate. These more recent systems, likewise described as demand-initiated regeneration softeners, are perfect since they conserve energy and money-- utilizing less water and salt for regrowth.</p>
