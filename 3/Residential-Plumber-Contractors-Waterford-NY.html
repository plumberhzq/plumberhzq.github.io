<p>If you are discovering low water pressure, problems utilizing more than one component at a time, or rusty or red water, then you ought to most likely get some repiping done. Repiping is the process of changing your rusty, older pipes with more recent and better ones that can increase the quality and pressure of the water in your home.

<p>Loosen up the screws on the upper mount ring (flange install) enough to press the phone a bit - you'll see a little "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the mount ring from sliding off the flange). Use a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and eliminate the mount ring and upper "protector" ring versus the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if applicable) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the new system.</p>
<p>Since they're less vulnerable to rust, stainless steel blades are typically preferred. Other great options are overload defense, which shuts off the motor if it begins to get too hot; an auto-reverse feature to avoid jamming; and a dishwasher-drain connection so food particles from the dirty dishes get ground up in the disposal. And if your home is on a septic tank, you'll need a disposal particularly created to be used with a septic system. gives an overview 1 of garbage disposals and septic systems.</p>
