<p>If you decide to attempt this task yourself, be prepared to keep meticulous track of about a dozen small parts (put the stopper in the sink so none of them fall down the drain). There are various faucet styles, so you might not have the ability to inform what to replace up until you have actually done the disassembly. Whether you do it yourself or work with a plumber, this would be a good time to think about whether you wish to update the faucet with a brand-new style.</p>
