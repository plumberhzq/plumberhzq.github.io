<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are usually set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are centers designed for the short-term staging of water materials and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators instead of water storage units. Because water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain approximately continuous, usage never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water circulation is greater than need (typically night-time hours), the excess supply of water is safely and cleanly stored for later use when demand rate surpasses supply (usually throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
