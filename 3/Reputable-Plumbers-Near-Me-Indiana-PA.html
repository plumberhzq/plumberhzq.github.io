Usually, the first 2 numbers show the year of your water heater.</p>
<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most common type of device. It has 2 check valves in a totally closed body-- two layers of backflow defense. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow situation. When you eventually test a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That means that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense fails (both examine valves stop working to hold), a backflow scenario might take place. That is why this kind of valve is not defined for what a water company considers high risk" facilities.</p>
