<p>Electrolysis: This technique uses what is basically a battery. Metal electrodes are immersed in the water and release positive zinc ions, which likewise launch electrons that move through the wire to the cathode. This procedure ultimately ceases when the zinc anode dissolves.

At the time of inspection, make sure to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can look at the whole system.</p>
