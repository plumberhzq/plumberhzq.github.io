The very best strainers have either a spin-lock or a twist-and-drop design stopper. The spin-lock stopper doesn't have any parts that can wear, but screwing it in and out can be annoying.

We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost really rapidly.
