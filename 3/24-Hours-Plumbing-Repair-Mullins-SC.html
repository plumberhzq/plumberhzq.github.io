<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are normally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are facilities created for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators rather than water storage units. Considering that water need varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay roughly consistent, usage never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is higher than need (typically night-time hours), the excess water supply is safely and cleanly saved for later usage when need rate exceeds supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
