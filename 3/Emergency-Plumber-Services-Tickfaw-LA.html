The client has one month to complete installation and testing of a backflow prevention assembly (check the due date on Notification of Requirements form).

<p>To reduce the need of gas line repair, it is very important to understand the common reasons for gas leaks. Indoor gas leaks from heaters, ranges, ovens and other gas-burning home appliances occur most typically in the winter.

We suggest installing carbon monoxide detectors outside of bedroom doors to notify you of any potential gas leakages if you have not done so already.</p>
