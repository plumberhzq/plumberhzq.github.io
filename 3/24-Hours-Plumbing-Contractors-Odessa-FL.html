The repair may be as easy as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces data on the functions of the assembly.

Making certain the salt water tank never lacks salt will extend the system's life.  Protecting the resin bed from high levels of iron and manganese will also protect the system. Iron will foul the resin and lower its ion exchange performance. Resin cleaners improve the regrowth cycle and assistance relieve the resin beads of hardness-causing minerals.</p>
<p>This ion exchange procedure is assisted in by resin beads in the water softener that are charged with salt ions. This is another mix that can deal with sink clogs.
