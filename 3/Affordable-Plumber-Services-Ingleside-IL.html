The repair may be as basic as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to know what the field test information indicates for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester interprets the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
