<p>During typical operation, the pressure between the 2 check valves, referred to as the zone of reduced pressure, is preserved at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve must leak, the relief valve is created to release and open water to the outside.

<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to offer sodas beverages. Lots of, if not most, water pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water comes into contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate service (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been shown to be a risk to the digestion system. The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a minimized pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping including copper shall be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>
