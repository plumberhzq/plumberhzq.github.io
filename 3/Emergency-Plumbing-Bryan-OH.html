When the pressure drops for some factor such as might occur when the fire department links to a fire hydrant to combat a water or a fire main breaks or some other situation occurs, contaminated water might be drawn into the system. To avoid such an occurrence, there requires to be some type of backflow prevention approach made use of. The very best and most safe type of backflow prevention is an air gap (a physical separation in between the water outlet and the rim of the fixture).
