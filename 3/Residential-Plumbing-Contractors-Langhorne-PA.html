<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like material coated with favorably charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water streams through the unit while the resin releases its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>We are a licensed and insured  drain cleaning contractor who can clean out tough drain clogs and leave them working like new once again. It is called difficult water when water consists of a substantial amount of calcium and magnesium.
