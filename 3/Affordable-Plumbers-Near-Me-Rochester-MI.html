<h3>Signs That Your Water Heater Needs To Be Repaired Or Replaced in Rochester MI</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves must remain open and the system must be constantly kept an eye on. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both methods. NFPA 13 refers to all such devices as supervisory gadgets.</p>
