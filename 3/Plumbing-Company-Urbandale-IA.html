<p>The average cost for trenchless pipe repair is normally around $6,000-$ 12,000, while dig-and-replace repairs are normally in between $4,000-$ 13,000 (the bigger cost range accounting for manual digging, depth and pipe place).

<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really quickly. This is the main reason why we will advise a complete repipe in particular areas, based upon our experience.</p>
