<p>Storage centers and rise tanks are generally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically in between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are centers developed for the short-term staging of water materials and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators rather than water storage systems. Considering that water need varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay roughly constant, usage never exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is greater than need (normally night-time hours), the excess water supply is safely and cleanly kept for later usage when need rate exceeds supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
