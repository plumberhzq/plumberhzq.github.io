The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment flows backwards relative to the instructions of the system's water system movement. This opposite circulation is normally localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller pipes based on car traffic on overlaying roads, vibrations from adjacent heavy devices operations, settlement of nearby soil or moving foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, and so on. The result is a total damage, dislocation or splitting in the pipe that allows water to get away. In some cases no apparent physical damage to the pipe is required, just the mechanical failure of an essential pump whose closed down results in a substantial pressure drop throughout the pipe network.</p>
