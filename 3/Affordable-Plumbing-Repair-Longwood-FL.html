<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water embraced the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential licenses released after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was evaluated at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was checked was attached. By code this backflow assembly need to be tested every year. Also allows issued for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard irrigation systems require an annually test. It is required that this assembly is checked in the spring prior to running the irrigation system.
