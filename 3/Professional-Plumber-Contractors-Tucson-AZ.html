<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation need, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. During periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's arguably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
