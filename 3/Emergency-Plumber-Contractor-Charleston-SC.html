<p>Tough water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it includes. When difficult water travels through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange process, so only softened water goes through to your home. When the resin bed fills up with firmness ions, it needs to be regrowed (cleaned).
