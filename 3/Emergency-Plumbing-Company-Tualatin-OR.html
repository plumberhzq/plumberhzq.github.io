<p>Harts has amazing customer service and reacted quickly to our plumbing emergency! Chris has actually been to our home in the past and is extremely well-informed and professional. Harts is a terrific local company to deal with. How will you handle a severe clog after it blocks a chemical drain cleaner? Blocked cleaner can develop a harmful pool in your sink, making any new effort to clear it more hazardous. You'll need to install that first if your disposal's installation will require a new installing flange in the sink. If you're replacing an old disposer, remove it as discussed above.</p>
<p>A decrease in supply side pressure caused by an incident such as a water pipe break, or a heavy water demand from activities such as fire fighting, triggers the supply pressure to drop below the customer side pressure. A fouled # 2 Inspect Valve allows the excess customer side pressure to act on the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge. Water will release up until the supply side pressure again surpasses the customer side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or until the shut-off valves are closed.</p>

Baffles: Baffles prevent silverware from getting in the garbage disposal, so you're only sending food and compostable waste down the drain.</p>
