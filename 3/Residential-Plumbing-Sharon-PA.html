About 10 percent more potassium chloride salt is used during the backflush operation. What we suggest is that your toilet is old. Older toilets may work just fine, but if your toilet is really old (and obsoleted in design), you might wish to consider a toilet replacement service by Vegas Valley Plumbing. Modern toilets are energy-efficient and conserve water when you flush, which not only is fantastic for the environment, but it benefits your pocketbook too. Plus, a brand-new toilet might make your bathroom remodel sizzle.</p>
