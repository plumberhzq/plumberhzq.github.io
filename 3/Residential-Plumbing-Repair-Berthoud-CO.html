<h3>Residential Water Heater Repair and Replacement at Berthoud CO</h3>
<p>You should update the piping as well if you are upgrading your gas home appliances. Gas leaks can be frightening and hazardous. We're here for you every action of the way. Call (866) 701-5306 to schedule a visit. An atmospheric vacuum breaker (AVB) is not a testable backflow preventer and is not frequently defined by water purveyors.  It contains an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In basic functional use, water pressure pushes the seat up and closes off the air inlet.  When the water circulation stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, allowing the device to drain along with preventing back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is extremely essential here.  This device just breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not protect against back pressure.  Think of this device as a frost-proof hose bibb with a vacuum breaker.  It likewise needs to be located a minimum of 6 inches above any overflow rim or downstream piping.</p>

<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Many home centers carry just one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" model, the door may not close. Keep reading to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
