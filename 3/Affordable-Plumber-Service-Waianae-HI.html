<p>Sewer linings can help to repair broken pipes without needing to completely replace your sewer lines or ruin the area around them. Your pipes are a significant part of your plumbing system, responsible for moving water all throughout your house. Over time, however, your plumbing pipes can wear, resulting in obstructions and leaks. This is particularly true in older houses, where old, steel piping has not yet been changed with more long lasting copper or plastic piping. Repiping is the task of changing an old our malfunctioning length of pipe in your house with a brand-new one. In many cases, whole-house repiping might be needed to replace all the pipes in your house.</p>
<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. But to do so, it should put something back into the water. Many water softeners use an ion exchange process where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for sodium ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the hardness ions (calcium and magnesium) attach themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when particular levels are met, and the system will need to have the sodium in the salt water tank renewed.</p>
