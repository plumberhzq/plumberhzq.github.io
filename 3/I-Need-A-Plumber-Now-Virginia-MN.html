<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are usually set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually in between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are facilities created for the short-term staging of water supplies and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators rather than water storage systems. Given that water need varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain approximately continuous, use never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water flow is higher than demand (normally night-time hours), the excess water system is securely and cleanly saved for later usage when demand rate surpasses supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
