<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather sensible. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
