<p>During typical operation, the pressure in between the two check valves, described as the zone of decreased pressure, is preserved at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. The relief valve is designed to open and release water to the exterior if either check valve need to leak.

For this factor, the RPZ should be set up in locations that are exempt to water damage and allow sufficient drainage.</p>
