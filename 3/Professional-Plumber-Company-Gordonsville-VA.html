<p>A. If you have rust areas, utilizing phosphoric acid usually will help remove them. , if you would like to attempt the gentlest approach maybe try using some Coke on the rust initially.. No, we aren't joking, Coca-Cola consists of a trace amount of phosphoric acid. To attempt this, drain the toilet bowl to listed below where the rust marks are. Then pour on some Coke. Wipe with a soft cloth and then more Coke, over and over, and so on.
