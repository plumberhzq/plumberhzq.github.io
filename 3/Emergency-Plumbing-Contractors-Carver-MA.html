<p>Current Evaluation: Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the previous. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very happy with their service.</p>
<p>Cooking oil and other greases should never ever be put down the waste disposal unit due to the fact that they can restrain the blades. Finally, cold water should be running when the garbage disposal is on and should continue to run for 30 seconds after the disposal is switched off to ensure that all food particles have been washed through the pipes. Baffles: Baffles avoid flatware from going into the garbage disposal, so you're just sending food and compostable waste down the drain.</p>
