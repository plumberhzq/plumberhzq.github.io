<p>To help prevent obstructions within the tee (a repercussion of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will link the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet continuous waste, rather than utilize the technique set out above. Since the baffle effectively halves the interior diameter of the tee, it's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up. This is especially true when the waste must take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and then change direction to fall down the trap. Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee permits a direct line to the trap that's relatively friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
