<p>Regenerate your softener with potassium chloride instead of salt chloride (salt). Potassium chloride is available at a lot of shops that sell softener salt. Since the softener's salt water tank nests inside of the salt tank, a single tank or cabinet-style system needs less space. Clogged clog and drainage problems might start as small problems however can quickly accelerate into significant problems. A clogged drain can even lead to slow water drainage, flooding, sewage backup, and pricey repairs.</p>
<p>During the regeneration cycle, salt water (brackish water created in the salt water tank by mixing water and salt) is gone through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the style). As this brine goes through the tank, sodium ions are transferred (exchanged) for the solidity ions on the exchange resin and these solidity ions are subsequently sent to drain. This procedure continues till all the solidity ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll discover percentages of salt going to drain in addition to the hardness ions) and the bed is considered fully regrowed.</p>
