Some systems make use of both approaches. NFPA 13 describes all such gadgets as supervisory devices.</p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather sensible. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>
