<p>Current Evaluation: Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite sensible. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very happy with their service.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. Many house centers carry only one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend a lot more. Also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" design, the door might not close. Keep reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
