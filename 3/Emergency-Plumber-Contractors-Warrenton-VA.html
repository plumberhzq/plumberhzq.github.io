Switch off the power and water, then disconnect the disposal (If it's hardwired, shut off the breaker.) Eliminate the rubber baffle inside the drain-most just lift out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the obstruction with a set of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For instance, backflow can occur when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use. Because pressure is lost throughout these events, water is no longer being pressed forward into your home and will flow in reverse into the city water lines.</p>
