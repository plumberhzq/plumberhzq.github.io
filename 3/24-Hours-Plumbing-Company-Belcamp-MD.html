<p>If you're relatively unskilled, a water heater installation is not the repair on which to hone your plumbing abilities. So save yourself some serious difficulty by being honest with yourself about where your experience level is. Many backflow preventers are developed to permit the elements to be removed for repair while the main body stays installed in the piping system. Eliminating the backflow preventer to repair it is not necessary in many cases. Some elements such as relief valve bodies may need to be eliminated from the main body to help with a repair. Knowing the proper order for disassembly of the backflow preventer can be crucial.</p>
