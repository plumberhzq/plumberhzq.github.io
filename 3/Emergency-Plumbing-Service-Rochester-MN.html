<h3>Plumbing, Drains & Water Cleanup Rochester MN</h3>
<p>In some cases, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information implies for that particular assembly.  When a skilled tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
