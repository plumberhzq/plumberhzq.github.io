For instance, a 2-inch service line connected to a 6-inch supply line will have the very same pressure.

<p>Throughout typical operation, the pressure between the 2 check valves, referred to as the zone of minimized pressure, is preserved at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. The relief valve is created to open and release water to the outside if either check valve ought to leak.

For this reason, the RPZ needs to be installed in areas that are not subject to water damage and allow adequate drainage.</p>
