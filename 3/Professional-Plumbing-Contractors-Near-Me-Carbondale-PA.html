<p>A reduction in supply side pressure triggered by an event such as a water pipe break, or a heavy water need from activities such as fire fighting, triggers the supply pressure to drop listed below the customer side pressure. A fouled # 2 Check Valve allows the excess customer side pressure to act upon the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge. Water will discharge until the supply side pressure again surpasses the customer side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or till the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. Most house centers carry only one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest much more. Likewise measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with a lengthened" design, the door might not close. Keep reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
