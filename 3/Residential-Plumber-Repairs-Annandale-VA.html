Instead, it grinds it into a paste at high speed so that it can quickly stream into the drain pipe together with the rest of your wastewater.</p>
<p>Garbage disposals are developed to operate in one of two methods. Either through what's called a batch feed, where the unit is filled, then covered prior to it is turned on, or through a continuous feed, where the unit can be filled while it is running.
