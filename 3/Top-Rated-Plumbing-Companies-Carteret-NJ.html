<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was quite reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very happy with their service.</p>
<p>Difficult water, debris from old pipes or particles from a break in a city water line can prevent a flush valve from closing entirely. Running water through it from the supply line will clear the particles. Pictures 1 and 2 show you how to do this on one typical type of valve. Even though other valves will look different, the clearing process is similar. Nevertheless, you might have to remove a couple of screws on top of the fill valve to get rid of the cap.</p>
