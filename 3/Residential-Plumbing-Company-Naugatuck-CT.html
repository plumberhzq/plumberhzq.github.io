<p>Throughout the regeneration cycle, brine (brackish water produced in the brine tank by mixing water and salt) is gone through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the design). As this brine goes through the tank, sodium ions are moved (exchanged) for the firmness ions on the exchange resin and these hardness ions are as a result sent to drain. This process continues up until all the hardness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll notice small amounts of salt going to drain along with the solidity ions) and the bed is considered totally regrowed.</p>
