<p>In an irrigation system, backflow has 2 causes: back siphonage or back pressure. Practically all elements on a hot water heater can be repaired or replaced other than for the tank itself. When the tank rusts through, there is no way to repair it; replacement is the only option. Turn the waste disposal unit over and get rid of electrical cover plate. Take out wires. Insert cable television port (not consisted of) and run electrical cable television through access hole on bottom of waste disposal unit. Tighten up cable connector.
