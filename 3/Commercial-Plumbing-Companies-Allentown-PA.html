<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most typical type of device. It has 2 check valves in a totally closed body-- two layers of backflow security. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow situation. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you ultimately check a backflow preventer. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That means that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the second line of defense stops working (both check valves fail to hold), a backflow situation could occur. That is why this kind of valve is not defined for what a water company considers high danger" facilities.</p>
<p>Throughout the regeneration cycle, salt water (brackish water produced in the salt water tank by mixing water and salt) is travelled through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the style). As this salt water travels through the tank, sodium ions are moved (exchanged) for the hardness ions on the exchange resin and these hardness ions are consequently sent out to drain. This process continues up until all the firmness ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll discover percentages of salt going to drain together with the hardness ions) and the bed is thought about completely restored.</p>
