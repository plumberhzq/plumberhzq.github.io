<h3>How to Keep A Clogged Toilet From Becoming A Disaster in Winnetka IL</h3>
<p>If you see your water expense increasing, it could be a leak you can't see. Call us for our leak detection service today. If you see absolutely nothing obvious, insert the wrench into the motor spline, discovered at the bottom of the unit, and twist right and left. Check that the circuit breaker hasn't tripped and then try the reset button if the motor spins easily. If these procedures don't work, and your disposer's service warranty has actually expired, it's time to replace it.</p>
<p>Your primary step is to shut down the water. For the most part, you'll have a shutoff valve right next to the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you do not have a shutoff, shut off the supply of water at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your home. This is a great time to add a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leakages. This is also a great time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Photo 6). A versatile supply line reinforced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 at home centers and hardware shops. Pictures 1 - 8 demonstrate how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height before you install the valve (Image 5). Examine the instructions if your valve is a various style from the one we reveal. After installing the valve (Image 6), connect the fill tube (Image 7).</p>
