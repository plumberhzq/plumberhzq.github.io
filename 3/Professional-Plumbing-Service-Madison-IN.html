<p>Current Evaluation: Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the previous. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather affordable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
<p>After getting rid of standing water from the sink, pour about 1/2 cup of salt down the drain prior to you pour in the boiling water. Let it sit for a couple of minutes, and then flush with hot water to clear the mix. Have steel or iron piping and notice rust-colored water originating from your water devices? This is an excellent indication that your pipes might be rusting from the within and for that reason, need to be replaced. Remember that if the rust-colored water just includes hot water, the cause might be a rusted out hot water heater-- not your home's piping.</p>
