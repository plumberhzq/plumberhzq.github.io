Backflow is the undesirable flow of water or other liquids, mixtures, gasses or compounds into the drinking water system.

Atmos Energy does not maintain the natural gas lines on your residential or commercial property beyond our meter, this is the very same as other energies, such as your electrical circuitry and water pipes.</p>
<p>Your primary step is to shut down the water. For the most part, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you don't have a shutoff, shut off the water system at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your home. This is a great time to add a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leaks. This is likewise a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Picture 6). A versatile supply line reinforced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 at home centers and hardware stores. Photos 1 - 8 demonstrate how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height prior to you install the valve (Image 5). Inspect the directions if your valve is a different style from the one we reveal. After mounting the valve (Image 6), link the fill tube (Image 7).</p>

Contact Winters Home Services right away to sufficiently eliminate the item. Excavation: If the pipe is challenging to access, it can cost $1,000 to $5,000 to get to the leak due to excavation costs.</p>
