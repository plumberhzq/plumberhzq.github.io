The Supertech serviced our a/c system and got it up and running right in time for the warmer weather. The only thing that I would have liked was to have the tech explain what exactly was wrong with the unit, how he fixed the problem, and how to prevent a reaccuance. I would highly suggest Hunter for any problems you might have.</p>
