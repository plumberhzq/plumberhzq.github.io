<p>Video cameras are among the most valuable tools in the plumbing organisation. A. Generally wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>

<p>It is not constantly due to clogs that stem inside the home when drains are clogged. It is possible for drains to end up being clogged due to tree roots, also known as tree root invasion. When tree roots start to make their method inside someone's main sewer line, there is potential for this to cause drain problems. The type of drain pipes currently set up, such as cast iron, plastic, copper or clay, will figure out the extent of the damage that tree roots can cause to a sewer line.</p>

<p>Are rust or minerals building up in your water? The 2 dead giveaways of rust and mineral buildup are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals build up over time, they slowly start to restrict the flow of water, resulting in low water pressure. It takes a very long time for this much accumulation to happen, so by the time you observe it, it may be time to repipe. Red or brown water results when bits of rust break off from the pipes into your water supply, impacting your water quality.</p>

<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water adopted the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential permits released after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was tested at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was tested was connected. By code this backflow assembly need to be tested yearly. Also allows issued for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn irrigation systems need an annually test. It is needed that this assembly is tested in the spring before running the watering system. All testable backflow preventers should be tested yearly to guarantee the safety of the potable drinking water in your house.
