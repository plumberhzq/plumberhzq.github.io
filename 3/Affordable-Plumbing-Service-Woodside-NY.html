These are centers designed for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators rather than water storage units. Considering that water need differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay roughly constant, use never ever precisely matches supply.
