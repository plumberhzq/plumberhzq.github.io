It's pretty common for particles to wind up being flushed down our drains. Consider how often food particles, cooking oil and hair ends up in our showers and sinks.

<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of most repairs, there are a lot of other small toilet parts that should also be well kept to help prevent leaks and other toilet difficulties. For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense against leaks between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can begin to split and harden or simply be so squished that it doesn't fill the area along with it used to, and you wind up with water all over the location. Much like with the gasket, often your tank to bowl bolts and washers can end up being so used or corroded that they spring a leak. We highly advise also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure whatever is in good shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
