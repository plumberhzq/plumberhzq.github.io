<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Covington LA?</h3>
<p>Gas and propane that comes out of the ground is completely odor free. The egg smell associated with gas is a chemical blended into it so that we can smell it. If you smell a gas leak in or around your house, there are safety preventative measures you must require to secure yourself, your family and your home. Some jurisdictions likewise allow alternatives to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems providing dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the supply of water. This gets rid of the need for a backflow preventer, because each time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
