<p>Backflow prevention devices are designed to safeguard the general public water supply from cross-connections.

<h3>Necessary Services That A Good Plumbing Service Can Provide Montvale NJ</h3>
<p>An RP is a mechanical backflow preventer that consists of two individually acting, spring-loaded check valves with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, spring-loaded pressure differential relief valve in between the check valves and listed below the very first check valve. It consists of shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is geared up with test dicks. An RP is effective versus backpressure backflow and backsiphonage and may be used to separate health or nonhealth risks.</p>
<p>A. We strongly suggest a backflow preventer or vacuum breaker on any shared water source. Backflow preventers block any water from back or unfavorable pressure in your watering system at shutdown from entering back into your water source, therefore decreasing the danger of contamination of your water source. Many towns require using an authorized backflow preventer in drip watering systems. You might wish to contact your local municipality prior to installing your watering system.</p>
