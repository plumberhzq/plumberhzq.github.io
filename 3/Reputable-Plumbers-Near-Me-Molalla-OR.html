<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your service' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capability. During durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's probably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
