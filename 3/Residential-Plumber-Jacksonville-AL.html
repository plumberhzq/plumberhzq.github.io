Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee allows for a direct line to the trap that's fairly friction-free.

Commercial assemblies need to be checked every year. If you are seeking to install a brand-new sink garbage disposal system or you are planning to replace a currently existing unit in your house, here are a few things you may want to take into consideration.</p>
<p>When it comes to repiping and changing plumbing in your house, this is one of the first and main concerns that you should ask yourself.

If your house was constructed prior to the 1970s, we strongly encourage that you employ a plumbing professional to inspect your home's plumbing and inspect if there are locations that need repiping. Chances are that your house might need comprehensive repiping so that your house's plumbing can work at optimum rates if your home was developed years prior to that.</p>
