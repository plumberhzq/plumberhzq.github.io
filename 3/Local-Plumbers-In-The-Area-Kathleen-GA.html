<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years of ages and you need to hire a plumber for that burner package. The overall repair bill might remain in the $300 variety. A gas water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair bill is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Go for the new heater. To guarantee that we are offering high-quality work and consumer assurance, all our plumbers are background-checked, licensed, bonded, and thoroughly trained to safely carry out water heater replacements. In addition to traditional water heaters, we also install tankless hot water heater, and heatpump water heaters.</p>
