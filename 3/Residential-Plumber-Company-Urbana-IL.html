<p>During the regrowth cycle, brine (brackish water produced in the salt water tank by mixing water and salt) is travelled through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the style). As this salt water travels through the tank, salt ions are moved (exchanged) for the firmness ions on the exchange resin and these hardness ions are as a result sent to drain. This process continues up until all the hardness ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll notice percentages of salt going to drain together with the hardness ions) and the bed is considered fully regrowed.</p>
