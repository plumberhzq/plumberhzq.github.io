<h3>Everything You Need To Know About A Blocked Drain in Shelton CT</h3>

Shut off the power and water, then disconnect the disposal (If it's hardwired, turn off the breaker.)

For example, backflow can occur when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for usage. Due to the fact that pressure is lost during these events, water is no longer being pushed forward into your home and will flow in reverse into the city water lines.</p>
