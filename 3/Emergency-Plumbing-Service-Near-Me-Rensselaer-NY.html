<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical procedure filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like product covered with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water streams through the system while the resin releases its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>

Water softening refers to the elimination of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular method of water softening is through a procedure called ion exchange. During ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another kind of ion-- normally sodium.
