Since the baffle effectively halves the interior size of the tee, it's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up. This is especially real when the waste should take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and after that change instructions to fall down the trap. Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee allows for a direct line to the trap that's fairly friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>

<p>When it comes to repiping and replacing plumbing in your home, this is one of the main and very first questions that you ought to ask yourself.

If your home was built before the 1970s, we highly encourage that you work with a plumbing professional to check your house's plumbing and check if there are locations that need repiping. If your house was built decades prior to that, opportunities are that your home may need extensive repiping so that your house's plumbing can work at optimum rates.</p>

Clogged obstruction and drainage problems might start as minor issues however can rapidly accelerate into considerable problems. A clogged drain can even result in slow water drainage, flooding, sewage backup, and costly repairs.</p>
