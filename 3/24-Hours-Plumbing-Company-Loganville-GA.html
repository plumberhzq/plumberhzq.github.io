<p>The use of different metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic corrosion Direct contact between different metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever 2 different kinds of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is created because of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
