It usually signifies rust and mineral buildup if you discover low water pressure or tarnished water. As rust and minerals develop gradually, they restrict the flow of the water which is why you may see lower water pressure.

More pricey gas water heaters with special venting systems likewise are offered. However they're more difficult to install, and we won't handle them here.</p>
