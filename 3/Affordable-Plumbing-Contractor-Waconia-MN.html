<p>Replace what's exposed. For a home with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other functions that make it tough to access to in-wall pipes, think about a minimum of replacing pipes that aren't buried in the walls.

Toilets must definitely never wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing.

Improperly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, and even compromise the structural stability of the house.</p>
