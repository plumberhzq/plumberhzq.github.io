Well, first let's ask you a different concern: How old is your home? If it was built before 1970, it might have pipes made from an outdated material that will begin to offer you problems in the not-too-distant future (if they have not currently). And if your home was constructed before World War II, then it likely needs replacements for its old pipes, most likely whole-house repiping.</p>
<p>Sometimes a waste disposal unit merely ceases to work and you can't determine the cause. Waste disposal unit problems can be credited to a range of possible problems. The disposal might be clogged or jammed with an object that is tough to grasp or discover, and many house owners watch out for trying to fix a waste disposal unit themselves (and for good reason!). The National Contractor License Service maintains a list of each state's professional licensing company where you can look up your state's licensing info. Inspect the list of state licensing firms to discover whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List also keeps a licensing tool to inspect state licensing requirements.</p>
