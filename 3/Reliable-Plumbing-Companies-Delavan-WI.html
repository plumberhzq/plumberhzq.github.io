<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capacity. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line.
