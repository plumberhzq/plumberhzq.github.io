<h3>How To Repair Your Water Heater in Hummelstown PA</h3>
<p>Whether you need your toilet fixed or you need a brand-new toilet entirely, our plumber will give you fair and sincere costs for the cost of each service. The water heater is more than 10 years old. One of our numerous professional services at Ryan's Plumbing is toilet repair. A clog or leak in a toilet can cause water damage to your home if not repaired quickly. Doing a toilet repair yourself can be tricky if you aren't well versed in plumbing repair, so we recommend you leave it to Ryan's Plumbing to get your toilet working quickly once again.</p>
<p>Your first step is to turn off the water. In most cases, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you do not have a shutoff, switch off the water supply at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house. This is a great time to add a shutoff valve beside the toilet or replace one that leakages. This is also a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Picture 6). A versatile supply line enhanced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in the house centers and hardware shops. Pictures 1 - 8 demonstrate how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height before you install the valve (Photo 5). If your valve is a different design from the one we show, check the directions. After installing the valve (Picture 6), link the fill tube (Picture 7).</p>
