For example, backflow can take place when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for usage. Because pressure is lost during these events, water is no longer being pushed forward into your house and will flow in reverse into the city water lines.</p>
<p>Those of us in the market know that cross-connection programs in many locations have actually vastly lowered the variety of reported occurrences that occur within our water systems.

Every system may not need a minimized pressure concept backflow assembly.  In far too many locations we have an all or nothing approach to backflow protection. We need to take a look at each installation for the risk it provides and after that install the correct defense.</p>
