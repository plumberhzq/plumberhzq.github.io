<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are usually installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally between and aqueduct and the circulation water pipe. These are facilities created for the short-term staging of water supplies and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators rather than water storage systems. Given that water need differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay roughly constant, usage never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water flow is greater than demand (normally night-time hours), the excess water supply is safely and cleanly kept for later use when need rate exceeds supply (usually throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
