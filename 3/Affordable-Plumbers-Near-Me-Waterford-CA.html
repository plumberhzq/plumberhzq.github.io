<p>Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capacity to soften hard water. Through a process called regrowth, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a focused quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, offering the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>

The issue can be a deeper blockage somewhere in the main sewer line if the basic unclogging techniques don't work to fix the slow drain. Unfortunately, mainline blockages are usually much bigger obstructions than require more than easy unclogging approaches, but digging into the line itself to access the source of the issue.</p>
