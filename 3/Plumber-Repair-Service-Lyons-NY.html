<p>What is hard water? Clinically speaking, it is water which contains substantial quantities of liquified minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending upon the length of time the water takes a trip through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can get a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals will not damage your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and rather a nuisance-- for its many designated usages around your house.</p>

The city or Uruk consists of the earliest known examples of brick constructed Latrines, built atop interconnecting fired clay sewer pipes, c. 3200 BCE. 8 9 Clay pipes were later on used in the Hittite city of Hattusa 10 They had easily detachable and replaceable sectors, and enabled cleaning.</p>
