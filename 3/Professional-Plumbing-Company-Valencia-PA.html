Longstanding Obstructions: Obstructions that continue after you've tried to repair them call for professional support. Continued efforts on your own can hurt your lines, and you may have a more major underlying issue than you are aware of. Furthermore, the longer you postpone to call for professional assistance, the greater the probability that you will have sewage back up in your pipes.</p>
<p>When there are cracks or holes in your sewer line, sewer line repair is recommended. Replacement of the line is recommended if damage is serious. These are all signs that your unit should be checked by a plumber. We don't suggest attempting to repair this particular appliance on your own, due to the fact that it does present a safety hazard, due to the sharp blades that are used to grind and slice waste. You must also prevent utilizing any kind of chemical drain cleaners on your garbage disposal because these chemicals will only damage the home appliance even more.</p>
