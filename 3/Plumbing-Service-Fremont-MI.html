The rate to fix a toilet will depend on what is exactly incorrect with the toilet and whether or not we have easy access to work on the toilet. If you are searching for a specific price quote, we offer complimentary plumbing quotes, and one of our plumbers will come to your house and be able to supply an accurate quote.</p>
