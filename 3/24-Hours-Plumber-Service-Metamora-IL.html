<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health danger for people on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Usually, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in salt is small, however if you've been advised by a doctor to follow a rigorous low salt diet plan this boost can pose problems.</p>
