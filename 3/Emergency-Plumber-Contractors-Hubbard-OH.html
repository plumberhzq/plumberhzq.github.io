<p>Replace what's exposed. For a house with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other functions that make it tough to get to in-wall pipes, consider at least replacing pipes that aren't buried in the walls. Although it's a huge task, replacing exposed pipes in a basement, energy, or crawlspace  room is relatively straightforward, due to the fact that the plumber can easily get at the pipes. This is a bad indication. Toilets must absolutely never wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. If you can move a toilet around by doing anything less intense than swinging a sledgehammer at it, that toilet needs to be replaced. Improperly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, or even compromise the structural integrity of the house.</p>
