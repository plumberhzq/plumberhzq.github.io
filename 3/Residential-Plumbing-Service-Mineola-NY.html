In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to just desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future.
