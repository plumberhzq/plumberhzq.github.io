Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me a price quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary blockage, permitting the occupants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional examination, there was a significant obstruction that needed excavation to examine. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial concern and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed.
