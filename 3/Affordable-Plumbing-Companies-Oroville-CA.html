<p>Organic particles, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, drain or cable auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's DIY job. If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
