<p>Ultraviolet disinfection systems utilize UV light to destroy micro-organisms and offer purified water. The energy source required to heat the water is less costly. Calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions that cause water firmness can be gotten rid of fairly quickly by using an ion exchange treatment. Basic water softeners are cation exchange gadgets. Cations describe positively charged ions dissolved in the water. Cation exchange includes the replacement of the firmness ions with a nonhardness ion.</p>
<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are typically installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are facilities developed for the short-term staging of water materials and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators instead of water storage units. Given that water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay approximately constant, usage never exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is higher than demand (normally night-time hours), the excess supply of water is safely and cleanly kept for later use when need rate surpasses supply (usually throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
