<p>Our kitchen sink clogged over the weekend.  Since I like to prepare, I create a whole lot of meals. We established a temporary workaround at our guest bathroom sink, however after a day of this we recognized that we required the sink fixed ASAP.  Fritz was in and out of the home within thirty minutes and he ensures that the sink will remain clog-free for 1 month. If it blocks once again within that time, he will come out and fix it totally free - that is what I call service!  We are extremely pleased that we picked Fritz Drain Service to fix our kitchen sink and will absolutely utilize this company again and once again in the future.</p>
