To avoid such an occurrence, there needs to be some type of backflow prevention approach utilized.

<p>Regrow your softener with potassium chloride instead of sodium chloride (salt). Potassium chloride is offered at many shops that offer softener salt.

This process continues till all the solidity ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll discover percentages of salt going to drain in addition to the hardness ions) and the bed is thought about fully regrowed.</p>
