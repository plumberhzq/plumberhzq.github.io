<p>Based upon research study conducted by the Water Quality Association (WQA) Water Softener Benefits Study, 2011. Turn on the gas and examine connections for leaks by brushing a 50-50 mixture of dishwashing liquid and water over the joints. If the mixture bubbles, you have a leak.

It takes a long time for this much accumulation to take place, so by the time you discover it, it might be time to repipe. Red or brown water results when bits of rust break off from the pipes into your water system, affecting your water quality.</p>
