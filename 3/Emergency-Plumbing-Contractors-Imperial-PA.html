<p>Trees and shrubs are a typical cause of sewer clogs to the home. Roots can turn into the tiniest crack or gap in your home's drain pipe, where they grow in the nutrient abundant environment supplied by the sewer. Flat roofings generally have drains spaced out around their border. The drains are linked to vertical pipes that are usually connected to underground horizontal pipes connected to local storm drains. Roto-Rooter can mechanically clean these drains from one end to the other to restore flow and avoid water collection on top of the building's roof.</p>

This process is a bit more pricey and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending upon the intensity of the clog. At the time of inspection, make sure to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can look at the entire system.</p>
