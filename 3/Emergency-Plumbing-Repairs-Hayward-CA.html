Galvanized steel (frequently known just as "galv" or "iron" in the plumbing trade) is relatively costly, and difficult to deal with due to weight and requirement of a pipe threader It remains in typical use for repair of existing "galv" systems and to satisfy building regulations non-combustibility requirements typically discovered in hotels, apartment buildings and other commercial applications.

Tankless units last 5-10 years longer than tanked systems and require less repairs gradually.

The California Contractors State Licensing Board (CSLB) requires licensed plumbers to restore their license every two years.</p>
<p>In many cases, leakages can be sealed by welding or comparable techniques. Nevertheless, if leaks keep springing up in the very same length of pipe, then it's very likely that you're handling a flaw in the pipe, which needs to be changed. A leak is just a matter of time if you observe rust or rust on a pipe.
