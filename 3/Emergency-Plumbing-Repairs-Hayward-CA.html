<p>In many cases, leakages can be sealed by welding or comparable techniques. Nevertheless, if leaks keep springing up in the very same length of pipe, then it's very likely that you're handling a flaw in the pipe, which needs to be changed. A leak is just a matter of time if you observe rust or rust on a pipe.
