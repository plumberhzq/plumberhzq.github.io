<p>A. If you have rust areas, utilizing phosphoric acid typically will help eliminate them. If you would like to attempt the gentlest technique maybe try utilizing some Coke on the rust first.  No, we aren't kidding, Coca-Cola contains a trace quantity of phosphoric acid. To try this, drain the toilet bowl to below where the rust marks are. Then pour on some Coke. Wipe with a soft fabric and then more Coke, over and over, and so on. If that does not do the trick then utilize Naval Jelly which contains a lot more phosphoric acid (be sure to read the instructions and security warnings initially!).
