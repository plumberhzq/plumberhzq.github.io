Many steamfitters, plumbers, and pipefitters learn their trade through a 4- or 5-year apprenticeship. Apprentices generally receive 2,000 hours of paid on-the-job training, along with some technical instruction, each year. Technical instruction consists of safety, local plumbing codes and policies, and blueprint reading. Apprentices likewise study mathematics, applied physics, and chemistry. Apprenticeship programs are sponsored by unions, trade associations, and organisations. Most apprentices get in a program directly, but some start as assistants or complete a pre-apprenticeship training programs in plumbing and other trades.</p>
