<p>Replace what's exposed. For a house with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other functions that make it hard to access to in-wall pipes, think about a minimum of replacing pipes that aren't buried in the walls. Although it's a huge job, changing exposed pipes in a basement, utility, or crawlspace  room is fairly simple, because the plumber can easily get at the pipes. This is a bad indication. Toilets need to absolutely never ever wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing.
