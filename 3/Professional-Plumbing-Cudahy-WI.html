<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. Throughout durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line.
