<p>Backflow prevention gadgets are developed to secure the general public water supply from cross-connections. A modern-day neighborhood water supply system is designed to ensure that water streams to homes and structures under pressure. If there is a cross-connection in between the water supply and a polluted source, this community water network includes many users where there is a threat to public health. A cross-connection can happen where there is a pressure drop in the water pipe. This pressure drop causes a vacuum and siphons of entrainment water from end-users into the general public water supply.</p>
<p>In addition to backflow prevention valves, Sprinkler Warehouse also carries a wide selection of backflow prevention accessories.
