<p>In some cases, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test data indicates for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester translates the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>

<p>Storage centers and rise tanks are generally set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally in between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are facilities developed for the short-term staging of water products and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators instead of water storage systems. Considering that water need varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay approximately continuous, usage never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is higher than need (typically night-time hours), the excess water supply is safely and cleanly saved for later use when need rate exceeds supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
