<p>Cross-linked polyethylene or PEX pipes are a type of plastic pipe that is preferred for repiping plumbing lines, as they're flexible, versatile, and can fit into any space. Installing a new gas line in the kitchen will generally vary from $300 to $800 depending on the length of the pipe required. If you're converting your home to gas, or if the present line is at capacity, expect to spend $2,000 or more. Brand-new gas line costs consist of device connections, shut-off valves, a gas meter, and connection of the gas to the main gas line in the street.</p>

Water will release until the supply side pressure again surpasses the customer side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or up until the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
