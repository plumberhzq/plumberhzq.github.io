<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of many repairs, there are plenty of other small toilet parts that need to also be well kept to help prevent leaks and other toilet problems. For example, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leakages between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can start to solidify and crack or simply be so squished that it doesn't fill the space along with it used to, and you wind up with water all over the place. Much like with the gasket, often your tank to bowl bolts and washers can end up being so used or rusty that they spring a leak. We strongly recommend also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything is in tip-top shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
