A garbage disposal works by shredding the waste into small pieces that can taking a trip through the sewage pipes without restraining water flow. By installing a garbage disposal you are assisting the environment by conserving the quantity of trash that gets sent to garbage dumps and other dumping locations. With a garbage disposal the trash is managed through already existing water infrastructure.</p>
<p>This ion exchange process is assisted in by resin beads in the water softener that are charged with sodium ions. This is another combination that can deal with sink blockages.
