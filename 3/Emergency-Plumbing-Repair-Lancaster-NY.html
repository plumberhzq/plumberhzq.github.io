<p>Backflow preventers must only be fixed when the data gathered from the field test indicates the assembly has degraded in its efficiency listed below the established minimum standard. The test treatment is a diagnostic evaluation of the functions of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer fails to satisfy this minimum standard, the backflow preventer need to be repaired or if essential, replaced. These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to degrade in its efficiency, it can still prevent backflow. The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working specifications. This means the assembly is repaired so that it can perform above the minimum requirement.</p>
