<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are generally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are centers developed for the short-term staging of water supplies and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators instead of water storage units. Considering that water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay roughly consistent, usage never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is greater than need (typically night-time hours), the excess water system is safely and easily saved for later usage when demand rate goes beyond supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
