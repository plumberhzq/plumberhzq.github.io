<p>Some manufacturers declare that the electrical devices they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one benefit declared for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promotion have actually been claimed, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only modify the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has revealed a decrease of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
