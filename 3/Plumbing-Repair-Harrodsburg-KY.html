<p>Regardless of the Romans' common usage of lead pipes, their aqueducts seldom poisoned individuals. Unlike other parts of the world where lead pipes cause poisoning, the Roman water had so much calcium in it that a layer of plaque prevented the water contacting the lead itself. What frequently triggers confusion is the large amount of proof of extensive lead poisoning, particularly amongst those who would have had simple access to piped water, 19 an unfortunate result of lead being used in cookware and as an additive to processed food and beverage (for instance as a preservative in white wine). 20 Roman lead pipe engravings offered information on the owner to prevent water theft.</p>
<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical procedure filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like product coated with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water flows through the system while the resin releases its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
