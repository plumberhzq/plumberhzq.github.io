<p>There's no part of your house that has more of a direct effect on your security, convenience, comfort, and reliability than your plumbing system. Then attach the drain (and dishwasher hose, if relevant). If your system is outlet-ready-- focus on this part-- make sure your disposal switch remains in the off" position before you plug the brand-new system in. While it's not likely that having a disposal launch while your head is pushed versus it will cause decapitation, it may frighten a couple of years off your life. Not that I would understand from experience. When to repair: Under no situations should your toilet move when you sit or push on it.
