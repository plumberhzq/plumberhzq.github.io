<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to include circulation rate capability. During durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
