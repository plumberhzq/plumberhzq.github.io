<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are typically set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally in between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are centers created for the short-term staging of water products and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators instead of water storage systems. Considering that water need varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay approximately consistent, usage never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is higher than demand (normally night-time hours), the excess water supply is safely and easily stored for later usage when demand rate surpasses supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
