<p>This is a completely legitimate concern that we hear a lot. The disposal unit is not, of course, as important as your hot water heater, water line, or drainpipes. However, it adds a fair quantity of functionality to the kitchen. A garbage disposal is a fairly small cylindrical device set up under the kitchen drain. When switched on, your disposal unit takes down wastewater and any product debris by centrifugal force. However it does not shred such particles. Instead, it grinds it into a paste at high speed so that it can easily stream into the drain pipe together with the rest of your wastewater.</p>
<p>The other distinction between continuous feed and batch feed is that batch feed disposals just squash the food in batches (for this reason the name)-- not at one time like a constant feed waste disposal unit.
