<p>To help avoid obstructions within the tee (a consequence of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will link the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet continuous waste, instead of use the method laid out above. It's simple for waste from the disposer to clog it up because the baffle effectively halves the interior size of the tee. This is particularly true when the waste must take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and after that change direction to fall down the trap. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee permits a direct line to the trap that's relatively friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
