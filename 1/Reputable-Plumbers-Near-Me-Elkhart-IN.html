Although it's a huge job, replacing exposed pipes in a utility, basement, or crawlspace  room is fairly simple, due to the fact that the plumber can easily get at the pipes. This is a bad sign. Toilets must absolutely never wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing.
