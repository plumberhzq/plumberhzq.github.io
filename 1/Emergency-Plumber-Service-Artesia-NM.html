We've currently seen what these two terms share, so what's the difference between them? When it comes to the problem of hard water, a conventional water softener in fact eliminates magnesium, calcium and silica ions, leaving it with little quantities of what is called momentary firmness". The softener changes these ions with salt through a procedure called ion exchange.</p>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to include flow rate capacity. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's arguably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
