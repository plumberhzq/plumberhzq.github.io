Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces information on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to know what the field test data suggests for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester interprets the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
