When washing items are utilized in hard water - hard water ions bond with surfactants making them not available to bond with water. It's a great concept to have a professional examine your drain system if you experience blockages and backups in your home more than a few times. A drain professional like TLC will use a camera to check your drain system.

This procedure continues till all the solidity ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll see small amounts of salt going to drain together with the hardness ions) and the bed is considered fully regenerated.</p>
