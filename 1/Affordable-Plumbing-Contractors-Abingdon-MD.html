<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are typically set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually in between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are facilities created for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators rather than water storage units. Since water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay approximately continuous, usage never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is greater than demand (usually night-time hours), the excess water system is safely and cleanly saved for later usage when demand rate surpasses supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
