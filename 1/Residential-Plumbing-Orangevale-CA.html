<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of most repairs, there are plenty of other small toilet parts that need to also be well kept to help prevent leaks and other toilet troubles. For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense versus leakages in between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can start to harden and split or just be so squished that it doesn't fill the space in addition to it used to, and you wind up with water all over the place. Just like with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl bolts and washers can become rusty or so worn that they spring a leak. We strongly advise also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure whatever is in good shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
