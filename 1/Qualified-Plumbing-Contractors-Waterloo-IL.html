Bell Cow is your reliable local plumber and sink repair professional-- from fast fixes to structural repair, we do it all.

<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason why we will recommend a full repipe in specific communities, based upon our experience.</p>
