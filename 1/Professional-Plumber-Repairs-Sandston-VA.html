<h3>Emergency Plumbing Services Sandston VA</h3>
<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water supply line pipe that was established in the 1970s. It was really promoted as the pipe of the future.

A clogged or backed up drain pipe is an issue. Often a homeowner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. In some cases unclogging a drain takes taking apart the plug and putting a hook to pull out hair and gunk. And sometimes even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even standing on one's head and murmuring necromancies to the drain gods.</p>
