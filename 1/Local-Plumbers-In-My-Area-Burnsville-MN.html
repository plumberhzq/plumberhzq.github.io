<p>A water softener has a resin tank consisting of countless tiny resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. The beads end up being complete of sodium ions from the water softener salt when newly restored.

The softener system then provides soft water for your usage. When water is warmed, difficult water triggers gray or white deposits. Water softening can be used to lower these signs.</p>
