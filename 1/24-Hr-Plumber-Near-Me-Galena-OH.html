<p>There are two popular mount systems utilized for garbage disposers: the standard 3-bolt install (if you've had a disposer installed for a long time, it's most likely mounted this way) and a more recent system called the "EZ Mount" by Waste King (Insinkerator has a comparable system called "Quick Lock"). Each accomplish the same job with little difference, aside from their installation. As the name implies, the EZ Mount system is planned to be easier to handle when repairing a system or setting up.</p>
<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are generally set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally in between and aqueduct and the circulation water pipe. These are centers created for the short-term staging of water materials and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators instead of water storage systems. Considering that water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay roughly continuous, use never exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water circulation is higher than need (generally night-time hours), the excess water supply is securely and easily kept for later usage when need rate goes beyond supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
