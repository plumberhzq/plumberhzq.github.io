Although it's a big task, changing exposed pipes in a basement, crawlspace, or utility  room is relatively uncomplicated, because the plumber can quickly get at the pipes. This is a bad indication. Toilets ought to absolutely never wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing.
