<p>A. If you have rust spots, using phosphoric acid typically will help eliminate them. If you want to attempt the gentlest method possibly attempt using some Coke on the rust first.  No, we aren't joking, Coca-Cola contains a trace quantity of phosphoric acid. To attempt this, drain the toilet bowl to listed below where the rust marks are. Then pour on some Coke. Clean with a soft fabric and after that more Coke, over and over, and so on. Then use Naval Jelly which consists of a lot more phosphoric acid (be sure to read the instructions and safety cautions initially!), if that doesn't do the technique. Naval Jelly is what we here at ® use to eliminate rust stains and it's easily available at most hardware stores.</p>
