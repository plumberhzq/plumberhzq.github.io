If you live in an older house (constructed pre-1970) or any house with galvanized steel plumbing, this is an option to consider. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for numerous years, but steel ultimately suffers from rust and lacks the toughness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
