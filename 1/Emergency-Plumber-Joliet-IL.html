<p>The check assembly was established in the 1950s for the fire security market, developing a redundancy created to ensure that a person check valve will continue to safeguard the city water supply even if the other fails. This assembly also allows the closure of one valve to minimize the pressure differential throughout the other, producing a more reliable seal and avoiding even minor backflow leakage. Test dicks, or small ball valves, allow the attachment of testing equipment that examines whether the double check assembly is functional.</p>
<p>Throughout the regeneration cycle, salt water (brackish water produced in the brine tank by blending water and salt) is travelled through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the design). As this salt water travels through the tank, sodium ions are transferred (exchanged) for the solidity ions on the exchange resin and these firmness ions are as a result sent to drain. This process continues up until all the solidity ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll observe small amounts of salt going to drain along with the solidity ions) and the bed is considered completely regrowed.</p>
