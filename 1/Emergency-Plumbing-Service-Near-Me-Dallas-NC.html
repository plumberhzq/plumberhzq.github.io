A versatile supply line enhanced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 at home centers and hardware shops. Images 1 - 8 demonstrate how to replace the valve. Set the height prior to you install the valve (Image 5) if the height of your valve is adjustable. If your valve is a various design from the one we reveal, examine the instructions. After mounting the valve (Photo 6), connect the fill tube (Picture 7).</p>
