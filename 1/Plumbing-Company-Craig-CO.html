It cost less than copper and was much easier to install. Regrettably, any house that plumbed with polybutylene is like a ticking time bomb. It is not a concern of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or supported drain pipe is an issue. In some cases a house owner can unclog a drain with a commercial product or with a plunger. Often unclogging a drain takes dismantling the plug and putting a hook down to pull out hair and gunk.
