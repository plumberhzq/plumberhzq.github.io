New meters need to fulfill guidelines and code requirements for their placement, and gas service providers may need a distinct meter for their services, limiting your choices. Do-it-yourselfers and contractors are responsible for scheduling inspections by calling the office number noted on the structure permit. Inspections should be made after foundation excavation (before pouring concrete), after rough-in (before concealing work), and upon completion. NOTE: If faulty work is found, the inspector will issue an offense notification, and a particular amount of time is allocated to correct the issue.</p>
