Water softening describes the removal of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular technique of water softening is through a procedure called ion exchange. Throughout ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another type of ion-- normally salt. The outcome is water that's been efficiently softened by getting rid of almost all traces of the minerals that constitute hard water.</p>
