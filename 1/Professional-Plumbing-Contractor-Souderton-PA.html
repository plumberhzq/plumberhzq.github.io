<p>In the next section, we'll take a peek inside a water softener and discover why plastics beads aren't simply for Mardi Gras.

<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical procedure filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like material coated with favorably charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water flows through the unit while the resin launches its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
<p>More complex is the double check valve assembly (DCVA). This device has found widespread use because it prevents both siphonage and back pressure. The paired check valves are set up in line with the pipeline and operate individually of each other. A set of four test cocks enable the operator to examine the valves and make sure they are not being required open by accumulated debris. Each spring-loaded check valve is set to enable water at anticipated operational pressure to flow through. Need to backflow take place, either due to siphonage or back pressure, the springs knock the valves shut tight, preventing the entrance of cross contamination water.</p>
