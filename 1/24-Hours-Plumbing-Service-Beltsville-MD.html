<p>Backflow is the undesirable reversal of flow of water which might bring dirty water or other, dangerous substances into the general public water system and private plumbing. Backflow can occur in a number of circumstances that might draw water from places such as garden water fountains, swimming pools, or lawn sprinkler systems into City water supply lines. Backflow can also carry water into your plumbing if it is connected to any outside water source. One example would be a garden hose connected to an external faucet with the end left in a mud puddle in a garden area.</p>
