Enzyme-Based Drain Cleaners: Like the baking soda and vinegar mix, an enzyme treatment will also keep pipes running smoothly.

<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to just desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason we will suggest a full repipe in specific areas, based upon our experience.</p>
