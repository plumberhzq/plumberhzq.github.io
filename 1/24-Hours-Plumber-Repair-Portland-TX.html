<p>Identification of liquid, air and gas leakages: Making use of electronic, thermal and acoustical imaging locating devices to identify leaks. Whether you need waste disposal unit repair or installation, Maeser can help. A waste disposal unit is an important kitchen home appliance in many houses today. While many kitchen sink disposers can manage almost any sort of food waste, they are not unbreakable. When a fork, bone or other item jams the impeller or shredding ring, the disposal will stop running. Worn impellers on older disposals can become ineffective, increasing the threat of drain obstructions.</p>
<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. However to do so, it must put something back into the water. Many water softeners use an ion exchange process where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for sodium ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the firmness ions (calcium and magnesium) attach themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when specific levels are met, and the system will need to have the salt in the brine tank renewed.</p>
