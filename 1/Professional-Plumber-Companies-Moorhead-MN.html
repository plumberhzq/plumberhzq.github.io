This has at times resulted in people thinking that backflow problems and problems no longer exist or that there may never ever truly have actually been a concern in the very first location. This thinking can be both harmful and counterproductive. Backflow occurrences in water supply are a result of modifications in pressure within that system.  Every system may not need a minimized pressure concept backflow assembly.  In far too many locations we have an all or nothing technique to backflow protection.

<p>Storage centers and rise tanks are normally set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally between and aqueduct and the circulation water pipe. These are facilities developed for the short-term staging of water products and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators rather than water storage units. Since water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay approximately constant, use never exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is greater than demand (typically night-time hours), the excess water supply is safely and cleanly saved for later use when demand rate goes beyond supply (usually throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
