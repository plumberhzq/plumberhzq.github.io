Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain.

These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to degrade in its performance, it can still prevent backflow. The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working specs. This indicates the assembly is fixed so that it can perform above the minimum requirement.</p>
