There are 2 basic types of toilet flushing systems; both types conserve water by using 1.6 gallons of water per flush. Gravity-fed flush toilets use the force of gravity and a siphon "pull-through" action to clear the bowl. Search for gravity-fed toilets offering high performance to efficiently and silently dispose waste.</p>
<p>Get rid of the locknut that holds the toilet valve to the tank. Push down carefully on the valve as you unscrew the nut. Pull out the old valve. Replacing the pipes in your house is vital for keeping a healthy functioning water system and a general ideal home plumbing system.

For instance, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense versus leakages in between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can begin to harden and split or merely be so crushed that it does not fill the area as well as it utilized to, and you end up with water all over the place. Much like with the gasket, often your tank to bowl washers and bolts can end up being so worn or rusty that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we highly suggest likewise replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make certain everything remains in great shape.</p>
