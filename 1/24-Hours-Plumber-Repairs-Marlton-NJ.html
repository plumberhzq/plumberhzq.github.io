<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to offer soft drinks drinks. Numerous, if not most, pipes are made from copper. When carbonated water enters contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate option (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has actually been proven to be a threat to the gastrointestinal system. The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a reduced pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping containing copper shall be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>

If your house has drain problems, it's time to call the pros from Benjamin Franklin Plumbing before your issue gets back at worse. If there is black sludge appearing on the sink, appearing out from the drainage hole, call a plumber in Perkasie at your earliest benefit.</p>
