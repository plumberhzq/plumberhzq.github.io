<p>In this scenario, filthy water from the hillside swimming pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. Dual flush valves are ending up being a growing number of common, as both makers and consumers look for new ways to save water. Double flush toilets enable the user to pick the level of water required to flush the toilet based on whether the waste is liquid or strong. We have actually all heard the old expression, "If it's yellow, let it mellow. If it's brown, flush it down." Well, lots of people find that squicky - therefore the double flush was born so you can still flush it down if it's yellow, you're simply using less water to do it.</p>
<p>First shut off the power to the hot water heater at your main electrical panel. Then follow the exact same draining treatments as for a gas hot water heater.
