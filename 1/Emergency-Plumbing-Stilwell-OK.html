<p>You may be familiar with galvanized pipe for gas". Black iron pipe is, put simply, the same thing, but without the zinc covering. The zinc finish on galvanized pipe for gas is suggested to keep the pipe from corroding from contact with wetness. While it does its task pretty well, gradually, it still does corrode. We can assist if you are presently experiencing clogged drains! When one or more of your drains are clogged, water will typically begin to back up into your sink, which can result in weird smells.

<p>A water softener has a resin tank containing thousands of small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When freshly restored, the beads become full of sodium ions from the water softener salt. As tough water passes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are brought in to the resin beads. There, salt ions are exchanged for the hard water ions. The softener system then provides soft water for your usage. Difficult water causes white or gray deposits when water is heated. Water softening can be utilized to lower these symptoms.</p>
