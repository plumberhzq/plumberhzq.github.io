<p>The typical service is to have the defective pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed: whole-house repiping. This is an alternative to think about if you reside in an older house (developed pre-1970) or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for many decades, but steel ultimately suffers from rust and lacks the toughness these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
