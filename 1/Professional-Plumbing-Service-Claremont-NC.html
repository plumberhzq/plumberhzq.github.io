<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that allows water to go through it in one direction, but prevents it from going backwards in the opposite direction. But is a plumbing disaster imminent or simply a concern for the distant future? Changing old pipes in a 1,500 square foot, two-bathroom home expenses $4,000 to $10,000, and requires cutting open walls and floors, so you definitely don't wish to get the job done before it's necessary.

This pressure drop causes a vacuum and siphons of entrainment water from end-users into the general public water system.</p>
<p>Typically nationwide, it costs in between $120 and $150 to install a garbage disposal.
