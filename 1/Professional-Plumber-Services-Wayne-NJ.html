<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In Wayne NJ</h3>
<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. When there is a decline in provided pressure to the water circulation, takes place. The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe sector flows in reverse relative to the direction of the system's water system movement. This opposite circulation is normally localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller sized pipes subject to vehicle traffic on overlaying highways, vibrations from adjacent heavy equipment operations, settlement of nearby soil or shifting structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, and so on. The result is a complete breakage, dislocation or cracking in the pipe that allows water to escape. Sometimes no evident physical damage to the pipe is required, just the mechanical failure of a key pump whose closed down results in a substantial pressure drop throughout the pipe network.</p>

It contains an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In standard operational usage, water pressure pushes the seat up and blocks the air inlet.  When the water flow stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, allowing the device to drain along with preventing back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is very crucial here.  This device only breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not protect versus back pressure.  Think about this device as a frost-proof hose bibb with a vacuum breaker.  It also needs to be located a minimum of 6 inches above any overflow rim or downstream piping.</p>
