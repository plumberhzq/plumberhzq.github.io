<p>Current Evaluation: Button Plumbing was fantastic. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super delighted with their service.</p>
