<h3>Plumbing, Drains & Water Cleanup Westland MI</h3>
<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water system line pipe that was developed in the 1970s. It was in fact promoted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was simpler to install. Regrettably, any house that plumbed with polybutylene is like a ticking time bomb. It is not a question of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or supported drain pipe is a problem. Sometimes a house owner can unclog a drain with a commercial product or with a plunger. Sometimes unclogging a drain takes dismantling the plug and putting a hook to pull out hair and gunk. And in some cases even then absolutely nothing gets that drain cleared, not even basing on one's head and whispering necromancies to the drain gods.</p>
<p>Here at High 5 Plumbing, our Denver drain cleaning group is proud to use Bio-Clean items for every drain-cleaning job. Bio-Clean is an all-natural service that's both harmless to your plumbing and extremely reliable at getting rid of gunk, waste, and organic material that so typically clogs up your drain lines. Caustic drain cleaners run along the bottom of your pipes, corroding the sidewalls and just partly repairing the problem. Bio-Clean is a solution of live bacteria that actively seek out natural material and gnaw at it, developing safe by-products of carbon dioxide, water, and mineral ash, all of which are easily dealt with at local sewage plants.</p>
