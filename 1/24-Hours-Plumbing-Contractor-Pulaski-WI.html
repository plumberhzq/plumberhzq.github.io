<p>Backflow preventers are critical for developing a safe water supply system. A malfunctioning waste disposal unit, grease accumulation, collected food and more can all add to a clogged kitchen sink. The sink is the focal point in the kitchen and when you have a clogged kitchen sink, that will cause problems. There are a number of methods property owners can unclog a kitchen sink, consisting of utilizing a sink plunger, snaking the drain, or using an option of vinegar and baking soda. For the more extreme clogged kitchen sinks, call your local Roto-Rooter plumber.</p>

At Polestar Plumbing, Heating & A/c we offer skilled drain cleaning services for all your home needs.

This is where you insert the snake into the pipe up until you feel resistance to separate the clog.
