<p>Your sewer line problem can lead to sewer backups, and they normally take place in the most affordable open drain. This kind of problem is typically the result of a blockage in the line. If you do not identify the odor coming from the sewer backup, you may recognize this issue because a backup takes place whenever you flush the toilet or run water in your bathtub or sink.

If, nevertheless, only one drain has backup problems, there's a separated concern with only that drain, which is not likely to be a sewage issue.</p>

Try freeing the jam by inserting a hex wrench of the proper size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom deal with (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
