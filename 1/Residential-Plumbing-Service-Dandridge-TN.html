<p>Clogs are quickly prevented with a couple of essential steps. Place drain strainers on all drains, if possible. These strainers catch hair, food and other debris before it gets stuck, preventing the need of drain cleaning. Although they do not capture everything, it helps the system considerably. Installing a tankless hot water heater is a higher upfront investment, but these units can significantly cut the cost of month-to-month energies. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that in homes using 41 gallons or less of warm water, on-demand tankless systems can save between 24% to 34% more energy than tank hot water heater.</p>

We hire only the very best hot water heater technicians, we appear on time, and we make sure you get exactly what you need-- whether from your present water heater or a new installation. Many clogs are caused by putting too much bathroom tissue into the bowl. Know just how much toilet tissue your toilet can effectively rid the bowl of per flush. Never place any paper item into the toilet bowl other than toilet tissue. Paper towels can quickly stop up the toilet drain line or trigger a clog further down the drain. Womanly hygiene items need to be gotten rid of in the garbage and never in the toilet.</p>
