<p>So, how does a softener understand when to come down to service? The timing of regrowth depends on the type of softener you have.

Newer systems utilize digital sensors that keep track of bead deficiency and other crucial metrics based upon your water use and therefore only regenerate when needed. These more recent systems, likewise referred to as demand-initiated regrowth softeners, are perfect because they save energy and cash-- utilizing less water and salt for regrowth.</p>
