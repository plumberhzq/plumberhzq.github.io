<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Millsboro DE?</h3>
<p>Search for a jam. Something too hard to grind, such as a piece of glass, might be jamming the motor. Turn off the power and water, then unplug the disposal (If it's hardwired, switch off the breaker.) Remove the rubber baffle inside the drain-most simply raise out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the blockage with a pair of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For example, backflow can occur when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use. Due to the fact that pressure is lost during these events, water is no longer being pressed forward into your home and will flow backwards into the city water lines.</p>
