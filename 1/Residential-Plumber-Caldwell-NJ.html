<p>The rust inside the pipe can break off and be performed through the taps. This will trigger your water to look rusty or brown, and the water may have a bad or foul odor to it. When the piping in your house starts to show any of these signs of rust, you will undoubtedly need to repipe the whole plumbing system. The factor a toilet will not flush could be a low water level in the tank or a clogged inlet. A clog in the trap or drain underneath the toilet can also be the cause. Hiring a licensed Montgomery County plumber is your first step; a plumber can diagnose the concern and repair it.</p>
<p>Water that has been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been eliminated-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA recommends that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not trigger this kind of deterioration A softener is merely recording some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (usually sodium or in some cases potassium).</p>
