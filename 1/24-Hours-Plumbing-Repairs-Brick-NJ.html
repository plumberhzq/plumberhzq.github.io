I really got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me an estimate. They instantly cleared the initial obstruction, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon additional examination, there was a significant clog that needed excavation to examine. His group was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial issue and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed.

<p>Although the service technician agreed that the customer did the best thing in her attempts to tighten up the pipes, the service technician saw that the pipe had actually ended up being very rusted over the years which a PVC pipe may be much better matched for the customer's requirements.
