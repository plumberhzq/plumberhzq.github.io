These are centers created for the short-term staging of water supplies and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds.

Since water need varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay roughly continuous, use never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is higher than need (typically night-time hours), the excess water supply is safely and easily stored for later use when need rate surpasses supply (usually throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
