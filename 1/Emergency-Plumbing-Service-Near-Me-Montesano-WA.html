<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water embraced the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential licenses released after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was tested at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was tested was connected. By code this backflow assembly should be tested yearly. Also permits released for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard irrigation systems require an every year test. It is required that this assembly is checked in the spring prior to operating the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers must be evaluated each year to insure the security of the potable drinking water in your home.
