No, we aren't kidding, Coca-Cola consists of a trace amount of phosphoric acid. To try this, drain the toilet bowl to listed below where the rust marks are. Then pour on some Coke. Clean with a soft cloth and then more Coke, over and over, etc. Then use Naval Jelly which contains a lot more phosphoric acid (be sure to check out the instructions and safety warnings first!), if that doesn't do the technique.

<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Many home centers carry just one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" model, the door might not close. Read on to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
