<p>Sediment Build-Up: If you observe strange popping, banging, or clanging sounds coming from your system, this might be a sign that sediment has actually developed in your tank, and is triggering a reaction with the heating aspect. Lacking warm water quickly is another indication of sediment accumulation, because the sediment is taking up more area in the tank, so your water for that reason takes longer to heat. To fix this problem, you will likely need to eliminate the tank.</p>
