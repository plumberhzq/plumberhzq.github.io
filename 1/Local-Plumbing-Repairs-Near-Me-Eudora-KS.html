<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Many home centers carry only one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with a lengthened" design, the door might not close. Keep reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
