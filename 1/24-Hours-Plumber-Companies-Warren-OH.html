<p>What is difficult water? Clinically speaking, it is water which contains substantial quantities of dissolved minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending on for how long the water takes a trip through the ground before reaching your tap, it can pick up a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals won't damage your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and quite an annoyance-- for its many intended uses around your home.</p>
