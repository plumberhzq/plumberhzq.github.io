Typically, it is possible to do the bulk of the work that needs complete water shut down while you are out and about throughout the day, so you experience very little disturbance to your daily regimen.

Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral material.

Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in salt is small, but if you have actually been advised by a physician to follow a rigorous low sodium diet plan this increase can pose problems.</p>
