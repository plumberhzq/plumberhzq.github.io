The test procedure is a diagnostic assessment of the workings of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to meet this minimum standard, the backflow preventer must be repaired or if necessary, changed. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to weaken in its performance, it can still prevent backflow. The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working specs. This implies the assembly is repaired so that it can carry out above the minimum requirement.</p>
