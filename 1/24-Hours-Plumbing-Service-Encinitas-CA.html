<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are generally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually between and aqueduct and the circulation water pipe. These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water materials and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators rather than water storage systems. Given that water need varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay roughly continuous, usage never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is higher than need (typically night-time hours), the excess water supply is safely and easily saved for later usage when demand rate exceeds supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and night).</p>
