Typical hot water heater problems consist of lukewarm or cold water, a leaking tank or scalding water. The cause of these issues can be hard to identify, so it is essential to work with a professional plumbing contractor who recognizes with the understanding required to find the issue and make the proper repairs.</p>
<p>Your primary step is to turn off the water. In many cases, you'll have a shutoff valve right next to the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall.
