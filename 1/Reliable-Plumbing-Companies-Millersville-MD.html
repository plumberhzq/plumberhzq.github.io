<p>I wanted to thank Clog Dawg Plumbing for the very best 1st experience with the beginning of our house enhancements. George and Anthony did a remarkable job for us. They exceeded and beyond any expectations that we had. They also worked around our particular requirements for our house. I will always use them and ask for George specifically for all future concerns or repairs. They were timely and offered excellent prices for what we needed done.

Seattle Public Utilities requires that any cross connection have a backflow preventer. The backflow preventer may be needed to be found on the water service line, within the building, or both places.
