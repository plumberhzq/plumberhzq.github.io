<p>Ultraviolet disinfection systems use UV light to destroy micro-organisms and offer purified water. The energy source required to heat the water is less expensive. Calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions that cause water solidity can be gotten rid of fairly quickly by utilizing an ion exchange procedure. Basic water softeners are cation exchange gadgets. Cations refer to positively charged ions dissolved in the water. Cation exchange includes the replacement of the firmness ions with a nonhardness ion.</p>
<p>Throughout the regeneration cycle, brine (brackish water produced in the brine tank by mixing water and salt) is passed through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the design). As this salt water goes through the tank, salt ions are moved (exchanged) for the hardness ions on the exchange resin and these hardness ions are consequently sent to drain. This process continues until all the solidity ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll discover percentages of salt going to drain along with the hardness ions) and the bed is considered completely regrowed.</p>
