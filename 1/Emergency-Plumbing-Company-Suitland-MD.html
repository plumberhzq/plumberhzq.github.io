<h3>Pipe Leak Repair in Suitland Maryland</h2>
<p>Tough water is softened by eliminating the calcium and magnesium it includes. When tough water travels through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange procedure, so only softened water travels through to your home. When the resin bed fills up with solidity ions, it should be regenerated (cleaned). Salt is usually used in the regrowth process and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can begin again.</p>
