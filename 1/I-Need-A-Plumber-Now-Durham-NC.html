<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are usually set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually between and aqueduct and the circulation water pipe. These are centers developed for the short-term staging of water supplies and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators instead of water storage systems. Since water need differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain roughly constant, use never precisely matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is greater than demand (typically night-time hours), the excess water system is securely and easily saved for later usage when need rate goes beyond supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and night).</p>
