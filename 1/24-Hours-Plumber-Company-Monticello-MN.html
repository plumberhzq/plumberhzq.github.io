We install effective systems that get you the water supply you need. We focus on doing the job right and as simply as possible to avoid problems down the road. If you have kids, remind them to avoid hanging on any noticeable pipelines or playing with the outdoor gas meter. Holding on a pipeline may cause it to come loose or break, releasing gas into the house. The outdoor gas meter should be kept clear of any particles, such as plants or snow, so it is easily accessible in an emergency.</p>
<p>Organic particles, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's cable, snake or drain auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself project. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
