<h3>Residential Water Heater Repair and Replacement at Tonganoxie KS</h3>
<p>Try to find a jam. Something too difficult to grind, such as a piece of glass, could be jamming the motor. Shut off the power and water, then unplug the disposal (If it's hardwired, turn off the breaker.) Eliminate the rubber baffle inside the drain-most simply raise out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the blockage with a pair of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For instance, backflow can happen when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use. Water is no longer being pushed forward into your house and will stream in reverse into the city water lines since pressure is lost during these events.</p>
