<p>To assist avoid clogs within the tee (a repercussion of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, rather than use the approach set out above. Because the baffle successfully halves the interior size of the tee, it's simple for waste from the disposer to clog it up. When the waste must take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and then change instructions to fall down the trap, this is specifically real. Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee allows for a direct line to the trap that's relatively friction-free.
