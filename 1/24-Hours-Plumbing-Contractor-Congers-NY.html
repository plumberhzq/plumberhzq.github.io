<h3>Warning Signs of Sewer Mainline Pipe Clogs in Congers NY</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves must remain open and the system should be continually monitored. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm system that informs the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both techniques. NFPA 13 refers to all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>
