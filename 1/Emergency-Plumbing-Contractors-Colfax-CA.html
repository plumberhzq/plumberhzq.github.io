<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water adopted the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential permits issued after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was evaluated at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was evaluated was attached. By code this backflow assembly should be tested yearly. Also permits released for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn watering systems require an each year test. It is needed that this assembly is checked in the spring prior to operating the watering system. All testable backflow preventers must be evaluated every year to guarantee the security of the potable drinking water in your home.

<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are normally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, normally in between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are centers developed for the short-term staging of water products and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators rather than water storage systems.

As so for those durations where water circulation is higher than demand (typically night-time hours), the excess supply of water is safely and easily kept for later usage when need rate goes beyond supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and night).</p>
