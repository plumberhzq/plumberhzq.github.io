<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water system line pipe that was developed in the 1970s. It was actually promoted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was much easier to install. Sadly, any house that plumbed with polybutylene is like a ticking time bomb. It is not a question of if it will leak, however when. A clogged or backed up drain pipe is an issue. Often a house owner can unclog a drain with a commercial product or with a plunger. Often unclogging a drain takes disassembling the plug and putting a hook down to take out hair and gunk. And often even then absolutely nothing gets that drain cleared, not even basing on one's head and muttering incantations to the drain gods.</p>

If your old device is connected with a steel gas pipe and you're installing a brand-new device, purchase a gas home appliance linking package and replace the steel gas pipe with the versatile gas supply lines stainless steel tube. However keep in mind, you can't link the flare fitting on the versatile gas line supply straight to a steel pipe thread. You need to install the flare fitting that's included with the package.</p>
