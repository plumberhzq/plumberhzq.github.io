Few homeowners are delighted with the concept of changing all their pipes, however handling the job prior to the plumbing system stops working allows you to prevent considerable home damage.</p>
<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Image 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on certain new sinks, but these will be labeled to that impact. If you can't use plumber's putty, use a non-water-based silicone. Excess putty will eject in between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten the locknut in location. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to insert the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without catching on the gasket.</p>
<p>Your old discharge tube most likely won't be the best length for your new disposal. If it's too long, just link it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation.

To avoid this, ensure the new waste disposal unit installation package consists of a tube, or purchase one individually at the same time for about $3.</p>
