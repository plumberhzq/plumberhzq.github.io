A garbage disposal fixes all of those problems, adding benefit. Simply switch on water at the garbage and the sink disposal does the rest - and even more silently than you think. By pulverizing food waste-- modern garbage disposals do not actually utilize blades - it's processed by water treatment facilities where the small particulates are easily filtered out and turned into strong fertilizer, which, in turn, can be sold to decrease the general expenses of treatment.</p>
