<p>Some makers claim that the electrical gadgets they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces.

While particle size reduction and plant growth promo have been claimed, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just change the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has shown a reduction of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
