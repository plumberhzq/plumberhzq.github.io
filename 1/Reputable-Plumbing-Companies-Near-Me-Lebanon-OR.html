Grains per gallon is specified as one grain (64.8 mg) of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) dissolved in one United States gallon (3.785 l) of water. Parts per million is specified as one milligram of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) per litre of water. To transform between gpg and ppm utilize the following element; 1 gpg = 17.1 ppm.

<p>A water hardness test would not show a reduced solidity. How do I know it's working? The FutureSoft is a salt-free system that does not pull out the hardness to replace them with sodium.

You will no longer have the disadvantage to hard water, i.e., scaling, engraving and obstructing of aerators while retaining the useful minerals. Likewise, since the minerals are not being pulled out of the water, you will not be decreasing the pH, which can cause water to become acidic helping it to stay alkaline which is really advantageous for you and your house.</p>
