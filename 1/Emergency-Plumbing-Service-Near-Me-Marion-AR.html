A gas hot water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric hot water heater cost about $400 to $800). That repair costs is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Choose the new heater.

Think about replacing your old toilet with a modern low-flow design if you're fretted about your water expense. The brand-new low-flow toilets work simply as effectively as any other type of toilet, and you'll conserve an unexpected quantity on your costs.</p>
