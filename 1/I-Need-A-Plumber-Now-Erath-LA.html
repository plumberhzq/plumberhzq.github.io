<p>A couple of local authorities require that the PVB be set up within 18 inches (450mm) of the connection to the water source, in which case you can't utilize a PVB unless the water source is at the high-end of the irrigated area. It might not be set up in any area where it may ever be submerged under water. Some towns do not permit the usage of PVBs with drip watering systems. Some don't enable the usage of a PVB at all, so check with your water company. A PVB backflow preventer may spill or spit water out of under the cap when backflow occurs, so it must be installed in an area where water spillage would not cause problems.</p>
<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to offer sodas drinks. Numerous, if not most, water pipes are made from copper.
