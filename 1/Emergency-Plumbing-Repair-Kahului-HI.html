<p>Sediment Build-Up: If you discover odd popping, banging, or clanging noises originating from your system, this might be an indicator that sediment has developed in your tank, and is causing a reaction with the heating element.

To fix this issue, you will likely need to flush out the tank.</p>
<p>The term difficult water refers to water with a high mineral content. These minerals can differ depending upon which area of the country you remain in, however many frequently consist of calcium, magnesium, bicarbonates, and sulfates.

These mineral deposits stay when the water is routed into pipes for commercial and residential use, unless the water is softened or filtered.</p>
