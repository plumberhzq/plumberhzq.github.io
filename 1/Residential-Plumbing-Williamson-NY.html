<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow demand, tanks come online to include flow rate capacity. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's arguably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
