Double flush valves are ending up being more and more common, as both consumers and manufacturers look for new ways to conserve water. Dual flush toilets enable the user to pick the level of water needed to flush the toilet based upon whether the waste is liquid or strong. We've all heard the old adage, "If it's yellow, let it mellow. If it's brown, flush it down."
