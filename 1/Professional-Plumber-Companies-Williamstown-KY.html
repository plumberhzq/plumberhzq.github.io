These are centers created for the short-term staging of water materials and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators instead of water storage systems. Considering that water need differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain roughly continuous, usage never precisely matches supply.
