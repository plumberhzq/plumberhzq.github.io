<h3>Plumbing Repairs & Services In Havertown PA</h3>
<p>Warning: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on many rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts off. This is because the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the watering system back into the water supply. The probability of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless in most cases it should be much less water.</p>
