<h3>Difference Between Plumbers And Plumbing Contractors Barrington RI</h3>
<p>Caution: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on most rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off. This is because the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the irrigation system back into the water supply. The likelihood of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless in many cases it must be much less water.</p>
