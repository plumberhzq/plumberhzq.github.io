<p>Our recommendation: Usually you'll wish to opt for PEX pipes not only because they are economical, but since they're reliable and simple to install. , if you have questions about what type is pipe is right for your house, speak with a plumber for more details. Attach the backup ring, the fiber or rubber gasket and the mounting ring to the flange from below the sink. Ensure you snap the backup ring in location.

In some cases, this includes bodily waste and can be cleared up with cautious use of a plunger. When it does not, however, you need a certified plumber to make it right.</p>
