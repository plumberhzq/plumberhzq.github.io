The correction needs to be made prior to water service is permitted if the current backflow is not up to District code. Cost for the device is covered by either the residential or commercial property or the renter owner.</p>
<p>However, this cost can as much as double when streets, sidewalks, utilities or driveways lie above the broken pipe. Displacing or bring back these ground-level components can run traditional pipe repair costs as high as $25,000, if not more, for a single task. In these circumstances, the cost of trenchless stays the exact same; as digging is no longer required, trenchless experts can fully repair or replace your damaged pipe without needlessly digging an inch of soil.</p>
