<p>Back-pressure is the reverse from regular circulation direction within a piping system as the outcome of the downstream pressure being greater than the supply pressure. This reduction in supply pressure occurs whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided (such as during water-line flushing, fire-fighting, or breaks in water mains). Waste disposal unit guarantees last approximately 5 years, but they can vary between 2 and 10 years. Since the typical life expectancy of a waste disposal unit is 12 years, you may want to purchase an extended guarantee. Many guarantees cover the cost to repair and replace typical wear and tear failures. To avoid additional breakdowns, house owners need to stay up to date with regular maintenance of their waste disposal unit.</p>

Because the pipes are much easier to gain access to and replace, it costs less to do the work and takes less time. Then, as your spending plan allows, we can address other locations of the home and slowly replace all of the pipes over a period of time, rather than at one time.</p>
