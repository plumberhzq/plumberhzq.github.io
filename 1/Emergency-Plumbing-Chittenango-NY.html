<p>Recent Evaluation: Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
