The type of new faucet you pick may be restricted by the number of pre-drilled holes in your existing bathroom or kitchen counter top. We had some family pertaining to stay for graduation weekend and we needed a brand-new hot water heater before they showed up. We looked around for a bit, however we got the very best quotes from Blue Frog. They had the ability to send out somebody out within a day or two. He was extremely friendly and nice. He said our expenses need to be lower now too.</p>
