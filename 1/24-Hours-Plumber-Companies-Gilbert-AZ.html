<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are typically set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are centers created for the short-term staging of water materials and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators instead of water storage systems. Because water need differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain approximately constant, use never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is higher than need (generally night-time hours), the excess water system is securely and cleanly saved for later use when need rate surpasses supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
