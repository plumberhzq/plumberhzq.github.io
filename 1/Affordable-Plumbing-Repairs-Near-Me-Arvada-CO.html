<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like product coated with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water flows through the system while the resin launches its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to provide soft drinks drinks. Lots of, if not most, pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water comes into contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate option (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been proven to be a danger to the digestive system. The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a decreased pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping including copper shall be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>
