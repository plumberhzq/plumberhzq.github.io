<p>A water softener has a resin tank containing thousands of small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When newly regrowed, the beads end up being filled with sodium ions from the water softener salt. As difficult water passes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are attracted to the resin beads. There, salt ions are exchanged for the difficult water ions. The softener system then delivers soft water for your use. Hard water causes white or gray deposits when water is heated. Water softening can be used to minimize these signs.</p>
