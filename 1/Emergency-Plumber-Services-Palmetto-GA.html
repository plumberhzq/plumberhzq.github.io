(Loosen up the other pipe connections, if essential, to insert the tube back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too brief, you may have to make a time-wasting journey to the shop. To prevent this, make certain the new waste disposal unit installation package consists of a tube, or buy one separately at the same time for about $3.</p>
