These are centers designed for the short-term staging of water products and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators rather than water storage systems.

As so for those periods where water flow is higher than demand (normally night-time hours), the excess supply of water is securely and easily saved for later use when need rate surpasses supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
