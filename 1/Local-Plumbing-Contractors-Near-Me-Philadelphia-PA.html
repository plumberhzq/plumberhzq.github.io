<h3>Local Plumbers & Contractors Philadelphia PA</h3>
<p>Caution: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on most rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump turns off. This is because the pressure variations brought on by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water system. The probability of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however for the most part it need to be much less water.</p>

Likewise, because the minerals are not being taken out of the water, you will not be lowering the pH, which can cause water to end up being acidic assisting it to remain alkaline which is very beneficial for you and your house.</p>

<p>Throughout the regeneration cycle, brine (brackish water developed in the salt water tank by mixing water and salt) is travelled through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the style). As this salt water travels through the tank, sodium ions are moved (exchanged) for the solidity ions on the exchange resin and these solidity ions are consequently sent out to drain. This procedure continues up until all the hardness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll see small amounts of salt going to drain in addition to the firmness ions) and the bed is considered totally regenerated.</p>
