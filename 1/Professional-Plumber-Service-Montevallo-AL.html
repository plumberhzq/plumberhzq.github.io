<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health risk for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Normally, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in salt is minor, but if you have actually been encouraged by a physician to follow a stringent low sodium diet plan this boost can pose problems.</p>
