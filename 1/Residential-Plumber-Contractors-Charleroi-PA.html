<p>Those of us in the market understand that cross-connection programs in numerous areas have greatly minimized the variety of reported events that take place within our water supply. This has at times resulted in individuals believing that backflow issues and problems no longer exist or that there may never truly have actually been an issue in the first place. This thinking can be both counterproductive and dangerous. Backflow events in water supply are a result of modifications in pressure within that system.  Every system might not need a reduced pressure concept backflow assembly.  In far too many locations we have an all or nothing approach to backflow protection. We need to look at each installation for the risk it provides and then install the appropriate defense.</p>
