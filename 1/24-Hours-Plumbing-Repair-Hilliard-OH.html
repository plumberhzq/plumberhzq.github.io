<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years old and you have to employ a plumber for that burner kit. The total repair bill may be in the $300 variety. A gas water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair costs is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Opt for the new heater.

Wipe with a soft cloth and then more Coke, over and over, etc. If that doesn't do the trick then use Naval Jelly which includes a lot more phosphoric acid (make sure to check out the directions and safety cautions first!).

<p>Search for a jam. Something too tough to grind, such as a piece of glass, could be jamming the motor. Shut off the power and water, then disconnect the disposal (If it's hardwired, turn off the breaker.)
