<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years old and you have to employ a plumber for that burner kit. The total repair bill may be in the $300 variety. A gas water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair costs is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Opt for the new heater.

In addition to standard water heaters, we also install tankless hot water heater, and heat pump hot water heater.</p>
<p>A. Utilizing phosphoric acid generally will help remove them if you have rust areas. If you wish to attempt the gentlest approach possibly attempt using some Coke on the rust initially.

Wipe with a soft cloth and then more Coke, over and over, etc. If that doesn't do the trick then use Naval Jelly which includes a lot more phosphoric acid (make sure to check out the directions and safety cautions first!). Naval Jelly is what we here at ® usage to get rid of rust spots and it's readily available at many hardware stores.</p>

<p>Search for a jam. Something too tough to grind, such as a piece of glass, could be jamming the motor. Shut off the power and water, then disconnect the disposal (If it's hardwired, turn off the breaker.)
