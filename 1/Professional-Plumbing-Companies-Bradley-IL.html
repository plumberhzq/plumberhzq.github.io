<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic supply of water line pipe that was established in the 1970s. It was actually promoted as the pipe of the future.

<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the previous. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super delighted with their service.</p>

Excavation: If the pipe is difficult to access, it can cost $1,000 to $5,000 to get to the leak due to excavation costs.</p>
