<p>To help avoid blockages within the tee (a repercussion of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge straight to the tee of an end-outlet continuous waste, rather than utilize the approach set out above. It's simple for waste from the disposer to clog it up since the baffle efficiently halves the interior diameter of the tee. This is especially real when the waste must travel horizontally (down the arm) and after that change direction to fall down the trap.
