<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to just abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason that we will recommend a complete repipe in specific communities, based on our experience.</p>
