<p>A reduction in supply side pressure caused by an occurrence such as a water pipe break, or a heavy water need from activities such as fire battling, causes the supply pressure to drop below the customer side pressure. A fouled # 2 Check Valve enables the excess client side pressure to act upon the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge. Water will discharge up until the supply side pressure again goes beyond the customer side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or till the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
