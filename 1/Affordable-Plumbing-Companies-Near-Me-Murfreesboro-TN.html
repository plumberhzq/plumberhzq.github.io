If the plumber finishes in 15 minutes, and dashes off to their next visit, they likely hurried the task (unless you have a very small plumbing system). Ask how long the inspection typically takes when you call to arrange your consultation.</p>
<p>Low water pressure. Your plumbing is sensitive to water pressure and counts on a good balance of water pressure in order to work efficiently. If your showers end up being frustrating, or it appears little to no water is flowing out of your faucets, it might be time for a sewer repair. Waters than consist of other anions such as chloride or sulfate can not be remediated by boiling, and are said to be "completely" hard. The only practical treatment is to get rid of all the ions, generally by the technique described listed below.</p>
