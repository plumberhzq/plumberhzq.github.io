<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most common kind of device. It has two check valves in a completely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow defense. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow scenario. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually check a backflow preventer. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the second line of defense fails (both inspect valves stop working to hold), a backflow situation might occur. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a public utility thinks about high risk" establishments.</p>
