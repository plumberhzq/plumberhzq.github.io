Before salt starts operating in a water softener it requires a little house time within the reservoir, since the salt is dissolving gradually. When one immediately starts regeneration after including salt to the tank, the water softener might not work according to requirements. After an approval of strategies has actually been issued and the assembly has been set up, it must be tested by a certified tester.
