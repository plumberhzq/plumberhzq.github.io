<p>To assist prevent blockages within the tee (a consequence of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge straight to the tee of an end-outlet continuous waste, rather than use the technique laid out above. Since the baffle effectively cuts in half the interior diameter of the tee, it's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up. This is especially real when the waste must take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and after that change instructions to drop the trap. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee allows for a direct line to the trap that's reasonably friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
