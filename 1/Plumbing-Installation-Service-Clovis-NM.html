<p>So, how does a softener understand when to get down to organisation? The timing of regrowth depends on the kind of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and recharge on the basis of a predetermined schedule-- state, 11 p.m. every three days, no matter whether the water actually requires it. When required, newer units use digital sensing units that monitor bead depletion and other essential metrics based on your water use and for that reason just restore. These newer systems, also referred to as demand-initiated regrowth softeners, are ideal because they save energy and cash-- using less water and salt for regrowth.</p>
