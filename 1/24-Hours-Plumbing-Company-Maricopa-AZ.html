<p>Current Evaluation: Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super delighted with their service.</p>
<p>Tough water, particles from old pipes or particles from a break in a city water line can avoid a flush valve from closing completely. Running water through it from the supply line will clear the particles. Images 1 and 2 reveal you how to do this on one common type of valve. Even though other valves will look various, the clearing process is comparable. However, you may have to remove a couple of screws on top of the fill valve to remove the cap.</p>
