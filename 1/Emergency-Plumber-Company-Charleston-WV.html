<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. The majority of home centers carry only one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest much more.
