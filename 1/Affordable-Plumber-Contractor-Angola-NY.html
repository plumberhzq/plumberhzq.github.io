<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather affordable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very happy with their service.</p>
<p>The City of Bellingham needs a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or possible cross-connection. The backflow preventer might be needed on the water service line, within the building, or in both areas. The backflow preventer you pick must be noted on the Washington State Department of Health's Authorized Backflow Prevention Assembly List. Assemblies not currently listed must have been listed at the time of the initial installation.</p>
