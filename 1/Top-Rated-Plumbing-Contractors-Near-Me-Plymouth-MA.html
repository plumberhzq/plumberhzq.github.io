The test duration will not be less than 10 minutes. The piping system will hold up against the test pressure defined without revealing any proof of leak or other flaws. Mechanical gauges used to measure test pressures will have a range such that the greatest end of the scale is not higher than five times the test pressure.

<p>Take note of the location if you or anybody in the structure begins to experience the above listed symptoms. Then it may be a gas leak, if symptoms afflict people in a specific place. Once a gas leak has been presumed everybody must leave the structure instantly and contact a professional. House owners can contact their local energy company, a licensed plumber, or the fire department if they feel security is compromised. Every toilet blockages every now and then. How often a toilet blockages depends upon the strength of its flush, the cleanliness of its drain pipes, and what it's attempting to flush.
