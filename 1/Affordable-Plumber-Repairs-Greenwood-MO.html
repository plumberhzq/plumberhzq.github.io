<p>A water softener has a resin tank consisting of countless small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. The beads end up being complete of salt ions from the water softener salt when newly regrowed. As hard water travels through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are attracted to the resin beads. There, sodium ions are exchanged for the tough water ions. The softener system then provides soft water for your use. When water is heated, hard water causes gray or white deposits. Water softening can be utilized to lower these signs.</p>
