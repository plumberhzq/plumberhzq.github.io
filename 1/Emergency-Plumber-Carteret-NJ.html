<p>Try to find a jam. Something too difficult to grind, such as a piece of glass, might be jamming the motor. Turn off the power and water, then unplug the disposal (If it's hardwired, shut off the breaker.) Eliminate the rubber baffle inside the drain-most just lift out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the blockage with a pair of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For instance, backflow can happen when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for usage. Since pressure is lost throughout these occasions, water is no longer being pushed forward into your home and will flow in reverse into the city water lines.</p>

Lots of blockages are triggered by putting excessive bathroom tissue into the bowl. Understand how much toilet tissue your toilet can effectively rid the bowl of per flush.

Womanly hygiene items need to be disposed of in the garbage and never in the toilet.</p>
<p>Although the service technician concurred that the customer did the best thing in her attempts to tighten the pipes, the technician saw that the pipe had actually become very rusted throughout the years and that a PVC pipe might be better fit for the client's requirements.
