<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like material coated with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water streams through the system while the resin releases its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>Our kitchen sink clogged over the weekend.  Considering that I love to prepare, I produce a great deal of dishes. We set up a momentary workaround at our visitor bathroom sink, but after a day of this we understood that we required the sink fixed ASAP.  Fritz was in and out of the house within 30 minutes and he guarantees that the sink will remain clog-free for 1 month. If it clogs again within that time, he will come out and fix it for free - that is what I call service!  We are extremely pleased that we chose Fritz Drain Service to fix our kitchen sink and will absolutely use this company once again and once again in the future.</p>
