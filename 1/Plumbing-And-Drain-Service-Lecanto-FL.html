<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water system line pipe that was established in the 1970s. It was actually touted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was simpler to install. Sadly, any home that plumbed with polybutylene is like a ticking time bomb. It is not a question of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or backed up drain pipe is an issue. In some cases a house owner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. In some cases unclogging a drain takes taking apart the plug and putting a hook to take out hair and gunk. And sometimes even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even basing on one's head and whispering incantations to the drain gods.</p>

Customer Detective Jodi Brooks called around to try to get a price quote from private plumbers for a waste disposal unit replacement. None of business we called would offer a quote over the phone. All of them wished to take a look at the scenario before dedicating to a price, and all wanted to charge a service charge to come out. Brooks found just one plumber who would come out without charging.</p>
