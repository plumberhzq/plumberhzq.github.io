<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most typical kind of device. It has two check valves in an entirely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow security. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow circumstance. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually evaluate a backflow preventer. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the very first line of defense stops working and the 2nd line of defense fails (both examine valves stop working to hold), a backflow circumstance might happen. That is why this kind of valve is not specified for what a public utility considers high threat" facilities.</p>
<p>The City of Bellingham requires a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or potential cross-connection.

Assemblies not presently listed need to have been noted at the time of the original installation.</p>
