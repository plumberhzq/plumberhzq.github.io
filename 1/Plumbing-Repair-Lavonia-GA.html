<p>To help avoid clogs within the tee (a consequence of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet continuous waste, instead of use the method laid out above. Since the baffle efficiently cuts in half the interior size of the tee, it's simple for waste from the disposer to clog it up. When the waste must travel horizontally (down the arm) and then change direction to fall down the trap, this is especially real. Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee enables a direct line to the trap that's fairly friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
