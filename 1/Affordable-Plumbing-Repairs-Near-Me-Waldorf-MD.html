<p>Loosen the screws on the upper mount ring (flange install) enough to press the call a bit - you'll see a small "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the install ring from moving off the flange). Utilize a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and remove the mount ring and upper "protector" ring versus the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if relevant) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the brand-new unit.</p>
<p>Water heater repair can in some cases be cost-prohibitive. You'll pay for the necessary repairs only to deal with another issue shortly thereafter.

Attempt releasing the jam by inserting a hex wrench of the correct size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit.
