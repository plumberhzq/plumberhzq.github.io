<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like material coated with favorably charged salt ions.

The water streams through the unit while the resin releases its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now thought about soft.</p>

<p>Water softeners come in all shapes and sizes and larger certainly does not mean much better. WaterBoss ® utilizes fine mesh resin - smaller sized beads that really provide more surface area to soften water. This resin is vacuum-packed to enable maximum capability in a minimum of area. Plus, our trademarked Directional Flow Screen system helps make sure that no resin bead goes unused. Our screens and whole-house dirt and sediment filter also secure the resin bed, so we don't need to lose space on freeboard" which is the empty area in standard water softeners that allow a churning of resin during regeneration to release firmness, dirt and sediment.</p>
<p>In this method, water is treated with a calculated quantity of washing soda (Na2CO3) which transforms the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their particular carbonates which get sped up. Fast heating gas heaters, as a basic rule, will warm water far faster than an electric water heater of the same fundamental measurements and capacity. An electric water heater may take a full hour to heat 25 gallons, and a gas heater might heat two times that quantity in the very same provided time and potentially much faster.</p>
