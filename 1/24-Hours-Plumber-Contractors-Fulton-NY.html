Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually check a backflow preventer. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That indicates that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense fails (both examine valves fail to hold), a backflow situation could take place. That is why this kind of valve is not specified for what a water company considers high danger" establishments.</p>
