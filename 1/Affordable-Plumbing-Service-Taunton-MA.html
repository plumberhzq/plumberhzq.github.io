Dual flush valves are becoming more and more common, as both makers and consumers look for new ways to save water. Double flush toilets enable the user to select the level of water needed to flush the toilet based upon whether the waste is liquid or strong.

The water suppliers generally do not have the ability to consistently inspect every consumer's facilities for cross-connections and backflow protection. Usually, this would consist of the water service connection to each committed fire security system or watering piping system and the water service connection to each of the following types of premises: (1) facilities with an auxiliary or recovered water system; (2) industrial, medical, lab, marine or other facilities where objectionable compounds are managed in a manner that could trigger pollution or contamination of the public water system; (3) premises exempt from the State Plumbing Code inspection and premises where an internal backflow prevention assembly needed under the State Plumbing Code is not correctly set up or preserved; (4) classified or limited centers; and (5) tall buildings.</p>
