<p>The rust inside the pipe can break off and be performed through the taps. This will cause your water to look brown or rusty, and the water might have a bad or foul odor to it. When the piping in your home starts to reveal any of these signs of deterioration, you will undoubtedly need to repipe the entire plumbing system. The reason a toilet won't flush could be a low water level in the tank or a clogged inlet. A clog in the trap or drain underneath the toilet can likewise be the cause.
