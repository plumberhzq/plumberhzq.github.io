Arm yourself with the best understanding if you desire to be successful.

<p>When a garbage disposal breaks, it is probably only a matter of time before your sink begins to clog, as you and other house members are probably not used to ensuring that no obstructive food waste goes down your drain. A backflow preventer stops water inside your pipes from receding to the City system if pressure is lost. Backflow can pollute the water supply.

The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a reduced pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping containing copper shall be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>
