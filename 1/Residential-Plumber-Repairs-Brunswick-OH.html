<p>To help prevent clogs within the tee (a repercussion of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet continuous waste, rather than use the method set out above. Because the baffle successfully halves the interior diameter of the tee, it's simple for waste from the disposer to clog it up. When the waste needs to travel horizontally (down the arm) and then change instructions to fall down the trap, this is especially true. Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee enables a direct line to the trap that's reasonably friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
