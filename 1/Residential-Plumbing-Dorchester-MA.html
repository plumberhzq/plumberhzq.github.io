The test procedure is a diagnostic examination of the workings of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to satisfy this minimum standard, the backflow preventer must be repaired or if necessary, replaced. These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to degrade in its efficiency, it can still avoid backflow.
