While obstructions are marked by gross smells and sluggish water circulation, they may lead to more severe problems, too, like rupturing and back-ups. Protect your drains, and remember to call High 5 Plumbing to look after obstructions ASAP. Worms for irrigation systems: Homeowners discovered parasitical worms (nematodes) in their water after the air pressure breaker malfunctioned on a privately owned underground sprinkler system. During a water pressure drop, the vacuum in the system sucked some water from the sprinkler into the city water. The homeowner discovered worms swimming in the bathtub while filling it to bathe his child.</p>
<p>More than manpower is essential to unclog a drain. Your local plumber needs to have the ideal equipment to get the job done. We utilize every type of drain cleaning machine out there, ranging from small hand snakes to drain makers capable of clearing big sewer mains. One of the most effective devices we have is the cable drain cleaning machine, also called the 'drain snake'. This machine clears drains and sewers by turning a versatile cable television made from wire through the pipe. Attachments at the end of the cable aid the procedure by scraping, boring, cutting pipe clogs like roots and sludge. Every type of pipe obstruction is different and requires understanding of the appropriate size cable and the best cutting head.

<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to offer soft drinks beverages. Many, if not most, water pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water enters contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate service (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been proven to be a threat to the digestive system. The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a reduced pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping including copper will be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>
