<p>The United States Department of Energy says that water heating can account for 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your house." It is the 2nd highest energy consuming area of a home, beside heating & cooling. The amount of minerals liquified in water can trigger it to take longer for water to heat, increasing those energy expenses.

<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like product covered with positively charged salt ions.

The water flows through the system while the resin launches its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
