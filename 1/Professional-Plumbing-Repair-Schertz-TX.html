<p>Jamming or Clogged: For the many part, a waste disposal unit is just equipped to handle softer organic waste. If bones or other hard foods get stuck in the disposal, it might trigger it to jam and not work effectively. By running warm water through the disposal, you might be able to clear the clog yourself.

<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost really quickly. This is the main reason we will advise a full repipe in certain neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
