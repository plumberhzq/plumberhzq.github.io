The paired check valves are organized in line with the pipeline and operate independently of each other.

Each spring-loaded check valve is set to allow water at expected operational pressure to stream through. Need to backflow happen, either due to siphonage or back pressure, the springs knock the valves shut tight, preventing the entrance of cross contamination water.</p>
