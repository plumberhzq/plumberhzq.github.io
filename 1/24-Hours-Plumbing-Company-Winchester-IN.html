It contains an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In fundamental functional use, water pressure presses the seat up and closes off the air inlet.  When the water flow stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, allowing the device to drain as well as avoiding back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is extremely essential here.  This device just breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not secure against back pressure.  Think about this device as a frost-proof hose bibb with a vacuum breaker.  It also needs to be located a minimum of 6 inches above any overflow rim or downstream piping.</p>
