And it's always good to get an even 3rd and second opinion prior to you embark on a replacement job. But there are a few methods you can mitigate the cost and inconvenience of the task.</p>

Use a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and get rid of the mount ring and upper "protector" ring against the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if appropriate) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the brand-new unit.</p>
