<h3>Hour Emergency Plumbing Service Waverly TN</h3>
<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to know what the field test information suggests for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester interprets the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
