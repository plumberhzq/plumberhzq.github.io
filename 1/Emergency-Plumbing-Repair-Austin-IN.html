Longstanding Obstructions: Blockages that continue after you've tried to repair them call for professional assistance.

This procedure continues up until all the hardness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll discover percentages of salt going to drain in addition to the solidity ions) and the bed is thought about completely regenerated.</p>
