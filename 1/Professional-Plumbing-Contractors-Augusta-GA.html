<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Augusta GA</h3>
<p>If your disposal is clogged, do not use harsh drain cleaning chemicals to try to unclog the unit. Chemicals can damage the mechanical parts, reducing the life of the disposal. Water leaks: If you see a leak in your pipes, there may be other leaks you are uninformed of. Leaks are a sure indication that your pipes are old and used and need to be changed. Instead of having to constantly repair them, the best option. is to replace them.</p>
<p>Water softening is the elimination of calcium, magnesium, and particular other metal cations in tough water. The resulting soft water is more compatible with soap and extends the lifetime of some devices. Water softening is normally accomplished utilizing ion-exchange resins. The waste disposal unit is leaking from underneath your sink. Push the pointer of a screwdriver up versus the edge of the plug and tap up until you break out the plug. Then remove this plastic disc from inside the disposal (you can probably hold the unit upside down and shake it out).</p>
