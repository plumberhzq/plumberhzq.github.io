For a cutoff switch where the backflow preventer lies downstream of the booster pump( s) - set at 20 psi.</p>
<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health risk for individuals on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Usually, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to start with. More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in salt is small, but if you've been encouraged by a physician to follow a rigorous low sodium diet plan this increase can present problems.</p>
