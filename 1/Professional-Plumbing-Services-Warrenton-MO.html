<p>Video cameras are one of the most important tools in the plumbing service. A. Normally wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>Align the rubber seal ring on the top of the disposer with the flange below the sink.

<p>Clearing of interruptions, or the repair of leaks in soil, waste, or vent pipes, valves, fixtures, or replacement of exposed traps in existing plumbing systems serving lavatories, sinks, laundry trays or comparable components. Leakages - If you see puddles on the floor, near the toilet, or water spots on the ceiling under the toilet, the wax ring needs to be changed. Turn the handle counterclockwise if it becomes hard to turn; it's likely you've come across an obstruction. Reverse the auger to pull it out of the drain and clear it of debris. Place it back into the drain up until you strike resistance again, then turn the handle backward and forward to work some of the clog free. Pull the auger out regularly to get rid of particles up until it moves past the clog without resistance.</p>
