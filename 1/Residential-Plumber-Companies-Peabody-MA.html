If you smell a gas leak in or around your home, there are security precautions you must take to safeguard yourself, your family and your home. Some jurisdictions also permit options to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems providing dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water system.
