<p>Our blocked drain Los Angeles solutions are tailored to your particular issue. Whether the clog remains in the kitchen sink, bathroom sink, or shower drains, we can clear it. Since it helps our plumbers to know the type of clog they may be dealing with, the location of the drain is essential. Shower drains generally get hair clogs, and kitchen sink drains are susceptible to grease obstructions. Find out how to find a natural gas leak and what to do if one takes place.</p>
<p>Loosen up the screws on the upper install ring (flange mount) enough to push the ring up a bit - you'll see a little "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the mount ring from moving off the flange). Utilize a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and get rid of the install ring and upper "protector" ring versus the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if appropriate) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the new system.</p>
