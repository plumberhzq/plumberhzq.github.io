This has at times resulted in people thinking that backflow concerns and problems no longer exist or that there might never actually have actually been an issue in the very first location. This thinking can be both unsafe and counterproductive. Backflow events in water supply are an outcome of changes in pressure within that system.  Every system might not need a decreased pressure concept backflow assembly.  In far a lot of areas we have an all or nothing approach to backflow security. We need to look at each installation for the hazard it presents and after that install the proper security.</p>
