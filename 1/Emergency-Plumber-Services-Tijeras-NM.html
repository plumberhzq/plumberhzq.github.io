We've already seen what these two terms have in common, so what's the distinction between them? When it concerns the issue of difficult water, a traditional water softener actually eliminates silica, calcium and magnesium ions, leaving it with small quantities of what is referred to as temporary firmness". The softener replaces these ions with salt through a procedure called ion exchange.</p>
<p>The most effective method to attend to hard water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When difficult water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
