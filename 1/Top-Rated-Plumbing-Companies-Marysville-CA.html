<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. When there is a decrease in provided pressure to the water flow, happens. The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe sector streams in reverse relative to the direction of the system's water system movement. This opposite flow is generally localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller pipes subject to lorry traffic on overlaying streets, vibrations from nearby heavy equipment operations, settlement of nearby soil or shifting structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, etc. The outcome is a complete damage, dislocation or splitting in the pipe that permits water to get away. Sometimes no apparent physical damage to the pipe is needed, simply the mechanical failure of a key pump whose closed down results in a considerable pressure drop throughout the pipe network.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health danger for individuals on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Generally, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to start with. More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in salt is minor, however if you have actually been advised by a physician to follow a stringent low sodium diet plan this boost can pose problems.</p>
