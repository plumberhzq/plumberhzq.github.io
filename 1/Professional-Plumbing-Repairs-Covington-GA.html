<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. When there is a decrease in supplied pressure to the water circulation, happens. The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment flows in reverse relative to the direction of the system's supply of water motion. This opposite flow is generally localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller sized pipes based on car traffic on overlaying roads, vibrations from surrounding heavy equipment operations, settlement of nearby soil or moving structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, etc. The outcome is a complete breakage, dislocation or cracking in the pipe that enables water to get away. Often no evident physical damage to the pipe is required, just the mechanical failure of a crucial pump whose shut down lead to a significant pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>
<p>The most effective method to resolve tough water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When tough water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
