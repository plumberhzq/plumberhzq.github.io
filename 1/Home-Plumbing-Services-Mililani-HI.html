However with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most home centers bring just one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs.
