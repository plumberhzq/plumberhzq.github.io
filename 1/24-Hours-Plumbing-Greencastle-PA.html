A few of the reasons for drain line clogs in kitchen drains are years of drain accumulation, a failing waste disposal unit, or too much food being disposed down the drain.

<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health threat for people on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Normally, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to start with. Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in sodium is small, but if you have actually been encouraged by a doctor to follow a strict low salt diet this increase can posture problems.</p>
