<p>Some makers declare that the electrical gadgets they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the removal of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promo have actually been claimed, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just change the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has actually shown a decrease of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
