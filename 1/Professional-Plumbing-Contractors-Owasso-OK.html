<h3>Seven Signs You Need a Professional Sewer Cleaning at Owasso OK</h3>
<p>What is hard water? Scientifically speaking, it is water that contains substantial amounts of liquified minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending upon how long the water takes a trip through the ground before reaching your tap, it can get a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals won't damage your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and quite an annoyance-- for its many intended uses around your house.</p>
