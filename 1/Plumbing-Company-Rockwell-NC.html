Switch on the disposal throughout this action to ensure it runs properly.</p>
<p>The other distinction between continuous feed and batch feed is that batch feed disposals just crush the food in batches (for this reason the name)-- not at one time like a constant feed waste disposal unit.

While gas leakages are uncommon, you need to leave the building right away if you see a smell like rotten eggs in your home.
