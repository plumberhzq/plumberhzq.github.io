<p>This is a totally valid question that we hear a lot. The disposal unit is not, obviously, as essential as your hot water heater, water line, or drains. Nevertheless, it adds a reasonable amount of performance to the kitchen. A garbage disposal is a fairly little round device installed under the kitchen drain. When switched on, your disposal system takes down wastewater and any product debris by centrifugal force. But it does not shred such debris. Rather, it grinds it into a paste at high speed so that it can easily flow into the drain pipe along with the rest of your wastewater.</p>
<p>Water that has actually been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been eliminated-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA advises that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not cause this kind of rust A softener is merely recording some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations at the same time (normally salt or sometimes potassium).</p>
