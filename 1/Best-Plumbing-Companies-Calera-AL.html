<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are normally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically in between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators rather than water storage units. Since water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain approximately consistent, usage never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water flow is higher than demand (normally night-time hours), the excess water system is securely and cleanly saved for later use when demand rate surpasses supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
