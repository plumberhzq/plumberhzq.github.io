This has at times resulted in individuals thinking that backflow concerns and problems no longer exist or that there may never ever really have actually been a concern in the very first place. This thinking can be both counterproductive and hazardous. Backflow occurrences in water systems are a result of modifications in pressure within that system.  Every system may not need a decreased pressure principle backflow assembly.  In far too many areas we have an all or absolutely nothing approach to backflow defense. We need to take a look at each installation for the risk it provides and then install the proper defense.</p>
