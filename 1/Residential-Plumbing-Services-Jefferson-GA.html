<h3>Things You Should Do Before Seeking An Emergency Plumbing Repair Service Jefferson GA</h3>

Toilet-flushing is the single most water-intensive activity in most houses and represent over 30 percent of overall household water intake. Toilets made prior to the 1980s might use up to seven gallons of water per flush (GPF.) Many are still on the job and still wasting water. Later on models from the 1990s cut GPF in half.</p>
<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health risk for people on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Usually, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to begin with. More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in sodium is minor, however if you have actually been advised by a medical professional to follow a stringent low sodium diet plan this boost can present problems.</p>
